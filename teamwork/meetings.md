When it comes to scheduling meetings, I am a firm believer in Maker‚Äôs schedule vs Manager‚Äôs schedule. In his essay, Paul Graham touches upon the topic of optimizing the number of meetings. In this article, I would like to talk about another related aspect of meetings, i.e. how to optimize the meetings themselves by establishing good meeting etiquettes.

These days most companies have asked their employees to stay at home and change their office work for a remote one. In such conditions, the issues of organizing video calls have become especially relevant. It seems that online conferences for dozens and even hundreds of people are a step towards a digital future without borders when people can work from anywhere in the world and get together for negotiations literally by click. But in reality, video calls are often not as good as you might imagine. Someone cannot install the necessary program, someone is nervous¬† because of the relatives in the background, and someone appears at an important conference call in his pajamas and using the nickname ‚ÄúDimonKiller666‚Äù. We have put together some simple rules for making video calls that will help make them comfortable for yourself and your colleagues.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic, which means that it is an infectious disease passing from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.
