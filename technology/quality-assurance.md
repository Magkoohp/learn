Many businesses have a process they undergo before the products are shipped off to stores across the country or globe – it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, but software QA is much the same. When you build a piece of software, whether a mobile app or otherwise, the first goal is to get design elements in place then from there, you ensure that the app functions as intended, meaning it both “looks right” and “behaves correctly” much like when building a physical product.

Software development goes through six main stages, otherwise known as the software development lifecycle. They are planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. After development, the next phase involving quality assurance and testing is crucial to the success of the software. Proper QA testing identifies redundancies, inconsistencies, bugs, and defects in a newly developed product. Without this process, there’s no way to find out the ability of the product to survive in the real world and to work as intended for many years.

Lean production is not a new concept. It comes from the manufacturing industry and was polished by Toyota in the seventies. However, Lean manufacturing principles turned out to be so practical and universal that they can be used to create innovations in other industries as well. In the Information Technology (IT) sphere, they are frequently used with the Six Sigma Principles, and in this article, we will explain what each principle means for Lean software development.

Shorter development cycles and faster innovation are the basic characteristics of the DevOps model. It has swept the market with new ideas and incredible solutions, leading to 74% adoption by global enterprises. The reasons are different, but the top ones are the ability to recover from a failure in less than 60 minutes, minimization of support cases by 37%, and overall need to “put out fires”. No wonder that Quality Assurance, as a stage of the software development process, had to adapt to the new reality of the DevOps model and change its traditional approaches.

System testing is one of the stages of the whole software system testing lifecycle (STLC), which comprises three others: unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing. Each of these stages has their objectives and technical features. This article dedicated to one of the most volumetric phases.So system testing is a software testing which executing on an accomplished integrated system with a purpose to find out if the structure, functional, data and other issues comply with initial stakeholders’ requirements. The main goal of executing this fraction is to checkup functional, as well as non-functional requirements in the system on the whole. Herewith testers detecting such defects as the wrong usage of system resources, unexpected combinations at the user level, incompatibility with an environment, unintended scenarios, absence of functionality or its’ incorrect performance and ect.Let’s have a simple example for a better understanding of how does this testing phase is executing. Imagine you are an electric guitar manufacturer. Electric guitar consists of many details such as fretboard, tunes, body, volume/tone controls, electronic fillings etc. Let’s say you completed chips and boards installation into the guitar body. Each of them has exact functions and resemble, in our case, separate units. But altogether, this units shape an integration system. In order to make sure they work properly you run a test-drive. So, actually, this verification procedure of integration system calls system testing. It shall be carried out on a systematic basis during the construction process to avoid unexpected surprise on the final chord. There is a big chance that off-color element in the very beginning stage of the whole product development lifecycle can roll back entire project.Within system testing stage the following types of tests should be executed:
