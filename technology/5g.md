The current year is replete with technological innovations that are capable of plotting a vector for the development of the entire industry for 2020 and subsequent years. The AI-operated robotic hand Dactyl that solves Rubik’s cube with one hand, the BERT, an advanced voice assistant, that launched a rocket into natural language understanding, smart watches with electrocardiogram sensors embedded – all these 2019 innovations allow us to suggest that the era of digital dystopia is just around the corner. With the tech industry becoming more advanced, cyber threats are expected to be complex and far-reaching. Fortunately, the cyber defence industry is not rest on its laurels, even now there are lots of methods to protect yourself from threats (you can read about it on Cooltechzone).

Why does 5G excite me?!? As a technologist (though I guess everyone on Hackernoon is), I have been on the never-ending hunt to speed up all critical things in my life. The internet is certainly one of those things. The theoretical maximum speed of 5G is 100x faster than current 4G technology. That is faster than a cable internet connection. It's more akin to having a fiber connection installed, but it's wireless! Doesn't that just blow your mind?

The fifth generation of mobile communication networks isn’t on its way; it's  already here. You’ve probably heard plenty about 5G in the past few years, as this promising new generation of wireless technology is what’s enabling the continued spread of the internet of things and a host of other digital innovations. Virtually all tech experts agree that 5G technology is a good thing, given that it will lead to faster connectivity and more secure networks. However, there are good reasons to believe that the staggered deployment of 5G technology will mean that it remains vulnerable to a number of security woes currently plaguing 4G technology.

Since 4G was launched in 2010 the network researchers started exploring the possibilities 5G might offer. Major network and mobile phone manufacturers such as Samsung and Huawei spent billions by mid-2010s on 5G technology and it's just about to come true. In most of the advanced countries such as US, UK, Japan, China, UAE and many other advanced countries have already started upgrading their networks to offer 5G speed in their major cities and it wouldn’t be more another 12 months when we will see most of the networks in the advanced countries offering 5G services.

I wrote an article titled “I Compiled a List of Tech’s “Next Big Things” So You Wouldn’t Have to” in 2018. It has since been read over 50,000 times and shared more than 1,000 times on social media. As anyone reading it in the 2020s will notice, a lot of what was written then is now obsolete. It is thus necessary to write an update, highlighting the key technologies emerging today that will be all the rage in in 2022, 2025 and 2030s.
