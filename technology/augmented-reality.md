AR is awesome and has an unrivaled potential to enrich customer experience in many verticals. However, it has a friction point in most cases: you need to persuade a potential customer to install an app first. AR Quick Look solves this problem for iOS. This is a native feature of ARKit which launches a model viewer right from the browser — that's why we call it native Web AR. It utilises .reality or .USDZ files, the latter is a file format developed by Pixar, and allows showing objects in incredible detail, adding animations and sounds, locking their scale to 1:1 so models show the real size of an object.

During the past few months - with the world locked at home and forced online to socialise, traits of the Metaverse have rapidly evolved and begun to redefine the way that people will interact online forever. Despite that, most people still haven’t heard of the term. So, what does it mean?

AR and VR are the most trending technologies of the running era. As both technologies mature, users can expect innovation expanding in 2020. Virtual Reality has always attracted me because of its ability to innovate the products. My team of AR developers recently made a virtual atm mobile application. The app is the network of virtual ATMs that eases up cash withdrawal without visiting an ATM. Users can withdraw cash from everywhere just by showing barcodes at any of our app supported shops.

Haptic feedback suits represent the next step towards true immersion in virtual reality gaming. Virtual reality works by establishing a space that can stimulate our senses enough to create the illusion of being in a different world. The current VR headsets on the market create this illusion by stimulating our sense of sight (through 6DoF visuals) and our sense of hearing (through binaural 3D audio), along with slight vibration feedback from the controllers.
