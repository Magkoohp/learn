This is a simple black screen console game where first the program will automatically generate a random number, and all the players who play the game here will continue to guess the number one by one and match it with the previous program. The game will end if it matches the program's generated number. Whoever matches will be the winner of this game.

Here, we will add another interesting feature which is a counter. What is a counter? It's not just a recorder that will keep recording how many times the player is guessing and how many guesses after which a winner is actually found.

SOLID Principles is a coding standard that all developers should have a clear concept for developing software in a proper way to avoid a bad design. It was promoted by Robert C Martin and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum. When applied properly it makes your code more extendable, logical and easier to read.

This post contains a step-by-step example of a refactoring session guided by tests. When dealing with untested or legacy code refactoring is dangerous and tests can help us do it the right way, minimizing the amount of bugs we introduce, and possibly completely avoiding them.
