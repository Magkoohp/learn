This is a simple black screen console game where first the program will automatically generate a random number, and all the players who play the game here will continue to guess the number one by one and match it with the previous program. The game will end if it matches the program's generated number. Whoever matches will be the winner of this game.

Here, we will add another interesting feature which is a counter. What is a counter? It's not just a recorder that will keep recording how many times the player is guessing and how many guesses after which a winner is actually found.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It is easy to pick up and begin with the basics. It is a general-purpose language and can be used for more a lot of things other than just web development. To get a job, you need to go beyond learning just the basics and have a solid understanding of the complexities involved in the language.

I faced a problem when I started learning programming. That problem was: I thought needed to have deep understanding in every field to do projects and make cool stuff. So I started learning coding seriously, but after a few week I lost my motivation, as it was not clear to me that how coding is going to help me make something that I'd like.

I still remember my first day at Outbrain. As part of the Bootcamp (training program), we were required to clone the code from a repository called the trunk (one monolithic repo that contained all our codebase). It took at least half a day to clone and build the whole source code. Over the next year or two in which my team worked with a monorepo, we just suffered — cloning the repo was time-consuming; the slow build/release time frustrated us; flaky tests and bad commits affected all the engineering; and let’s not even mention the IntelliJ indexing time, which easily afforded us time to run down for a chatty coffee break.

It seems that the last 5 years in the global economy and science have become the time of the innovation boom. So many different things appeared, so often one began to use new terms and epithets, previously unknown to the public, that in fact it can be argued that hype and innovation are synonymous.
