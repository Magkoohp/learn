The brain of a human child is spectacularly amazing. Even in any previously unknown situation, the brain makes a decision based on its primal knowledge. Depending on the outcome, it learns and remembers the most optimal choices to be taken in that particular scenario. On a high level, this process of learning can be understood as a ’trial and error’ process, where the brain tries to maximise the occurrence of positive outcomes.

The plethora of knowledge involved in Machine Learning is the most fabulous thing about the subject. The theoretical and coding balance requires a steady and disciplined approach. In this five series tutorial, we saw CNNs, where we saw various approaches to different scenarios, and then worked on word embeddings, which was our gateway to Natural Language Processing, and finally ended with Support Vector Machines(SVMs) which were as powerful as Artificial Neural Networks, during the time of their inception.

Gato from DeepMind was just published! It is a single transformer that can play Atari games, caption images, chat with people, control a real robotic arm, and more! Indeed, it is trained once and uses the same weights to achieve all those tasks. And as per Deepmind, this is not only a transformer but also an agent. This is what happens when you mix Transformers with progress on multi-task reinforcement learning agents.

The financial market has evolved from what it used to be. There are a lot of redundant pictures stuck in the heads of everyone who are not a part of it and do not know how far it has come. The financial technology sector has accelerated its development during the last two decades and has created opportunities for people to trade from all across the world utilizing either their home computers, tablets, or even smartphones.

In this era, technology has become a basic necessity due to its compactness and handiness. This alleviation in the use of technology has also welcomed new problems. One of the most crucial issues is security. Devices contain personal and critical data which is usually misused if it is not secured. This is why the functioning of cybersecurity uses Machine language and Artificial Intelligence. It implements protection tools to create a wall between user and hacker.

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents are trained on a reward and punishment mechanism. The agent is rewarded for correct moves and punished for the wrong ones. In doing so, the agent tries to minimize wrong moves and maximize the right ones.
