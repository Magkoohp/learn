This sentiment trails what experts term as a critical period in human history borne by an unrelenting health crisis and a myriad of flawed economic policies designed to suppress its impact. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, over 17 million Americans will permanently lose their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.

During the chaos caused by the global pandemic, P2P, or peer-to-peer, transformed into a growing worldwide movement can no longer be left in shadow. Some experts even regard it as a way to save the global economy from an all-embracive post-pandemic crash. P2P already proved to be advantageous against a traditional exchange model in a number of ways – not least because it allows higher inclusion and can freely function even in countries that do not define cryptocurrency under their jurisdictions. Take an example of India – it is about to embark on the biggest bull rally of all time, and P2P exchanges are the engine behind it. Besides, P2P may be a lifeline for SMEs hit by the economic crash most severely – in conditions where they do not qualify for the bank credit support, P2P may become the only way to bail out.

Supply chain finance is one of the concepts countering conflicting interests arising from buyers’ traits of extending their payment terms and suppliers’ desire to receive payment instantly. This model mitigates the risks involved in the financing of the increasingly digitized global supply chains by enabling adequate working capital and providing the appropriate liquidity. As such, a supplier, with approved invoices, can receive the full amount owed by sourcing for funds from financial institutions. In turn, the financiers can provide extensions on the payables depending on the credit-worthiness of the buyer in question.

The current push for DeFi has not only changed the way we engage with our everyday financial needs but has also introduced new means of accessing, supporting, and investing in new projects. Tagged as Initial DEX Offerings (IDO), the possibility of bypassing restrictions when identifying and investing in projects has improved crypto funding. However, this does not mean that other models of crowdfunding have become redundant. For what is worth, Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) is still the go-to option for projects that prefer to capitalize on established launchpads and introduce a more diverse array of crypto products not necessarily restricted to the financial sector.

There are lots of positives to take away from the ongoing DeFi renaissance. For one, the emergence of this concept has brought about truly liberating financial infrastructures designed to deploy user-centric solutions. With the help of DeFi, developers look to enable new paradigms in the financial sector, which hopes to strip away the input of intermediate service providers in banking processes. Fortunately, this unique approach to banking and related concepts has begun to catch the eye of industry participants. As such, it is no surprise that the DeFI landscape has attracted unprecedented coverage, with the assets locked in decentralized finance protocols registering exponential growth in just a short period.

Without any doubt, the current price movement of Bitcoin showcases the earning power of cryptocurrency, especially for investors who were smart enough to buy the deep. Recall that Bitcoin had crashed along with the global financial market at the peak of the Coronavirus panic in March. However, as it has done countless times in the past, Bitcoin rebounded effortlessly from this low and is currently on track to match its all-time high price mark.

The crypto industry is currently in a critical growth phase fueled by the influx of institutional traders and intensified engagement with crypto assets. This budding crypto era, connoted by the price rally of digital assets and the explosion of DeFI protocols, coincides with a period of increased uncertainty in a majority of traditional markets. Experts believe that the unbridled spending of governments in the guise of economic relief programs could lead to a catastrophic end. As such, institutional investors are increasingly opting for cryptocurrencies and precious metals to hedge against inflation. According to a report by Fidelity Investments, 36% of the 774 institutional investors surveyed across Europe and America own cryptocurrencies or its derivatives.

It’s been over a year since COVID-19 appeared, and it’s still painfully apparent that this crisis is far from over. In fact, it may even trigger the largest economic change since World War Two. According to Arthur D. Little, a management consultancy firm, COVID-19 has been the impetus for an economic shift from a resources-driven to technology-focused economic model, one where the principles of “green” and tech go hand-in-hand. In essence, it will be data, not natural resources, which plays the fundamental role in keeping the global economy running. One possible implication of this is a full-scale transition to a digital economy. Data will be the fuel which powers our lives – and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart technologies will have to hit the ground running.

Hi Dan Schatt, welcome to our series “Behind the Startup” tell us about your journey from the payments industry to decentralized finance (DeFi)?

My “Aha” moment was in 2013 at PayPal. We called ourselves “The Internet of Payments” and had spent so much time plugging into traditional payment and settlement systems around the world, eliminating buyer and seller frictions, as long as they all used PayPal. Moving bits of data is easy when everyone is using the same database.  I thought to myself, I don’t know if it’s 10 years or 20 years, but when distributed ledger technology scales, they will eventually overtake traditional payment networks. We started thinking about what infrastructure would be needed to spur the development of financial services for the “token economy” and that’s eventually how CRED was born!

The DeFi market has already tripled since the start of the year, which has led analysts to build a highly optimistic prognosis of Bitcoin price – according to some predictions, it may reach $220,000 before the year ends. Unsurprisingly, all of this points to a growth of public trust in digital currency, which could result in 72% of well informed US investors flocking the space sooner than later.
