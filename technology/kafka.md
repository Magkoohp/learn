I’ve assisted several large clients in building a microservices-style architecture using Kafka as a messaging backbone, having a reasonably good understanding of its abilities and the use cases that really bring them out. But I’m not a Kafka apologist by any stretch; any technology that has gone through such a rapid adoption curve is bound to polarise its audience and rub certain developers up a wrong way, and Kafka is no exception. Like anything else, you need to invest a significant amount of time in getting across Kafka and event streaming in general, before you become fully proficient and can harness its might. And be prepared to face one or two frustrations, to put it mildly, along the way.

Building an enterprise data warehouse can be either relatively straightforward or very sophisticated. It depends on many factors, such as the conceptual data model complexity and the variety of source systems. In many cases, applying the Change Data Capture (CDC) approach can make the data integration simpler. Fortunately, there are plenty of CDC tools available in the market, many of which are easy-to-use and affordable, while others are cumbersome and expensive (for what it is).

### [23. Lambda Architecture Speed Layer: Real-Time Visualization For Taxi [Part 1]](https://hackernoon.com/lambda-architecture-speed-layer-real-time-visualization-for-taxi-part-1-a31931tr)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/oJcyiih3JxQIYnSJChKYcEE1zXE3-h74x3wzk.jpeg)
Lambda architecture has 3 components, a) Speed layer, which is the streaming data layer or real time data layer, b) serving layer, which is the database layer, which is derived by aggregating data from speed layer, and c) batch layer, which is the set of computations which are perfomed on large sets of data, typically stored in a distributed file system. In this post i will be talking about how to implement the speed layer, by visualizing real time taxi data. Post that, the visualization will allow us to make some real time business decisions. Code for this article can be found here.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/mepk32ad.png)
This blog provides an overview around the two fundamental concepts in Apache Kafka: Topics and Partitions. While developing and scaling our Anomalia Machina application we have discovered that distributed applications using Kafka and Cassandra clusters require careful tuning to achieve close to linear scalability, and critical variables included the number of Kafka topics and partitions. In this blog, we test that theory and answer questions like “What impact does increasing partitions have on throughput?” and “Is there an optimal number of partitions for a cluster to maximize write throughput?” And more!

### [25. Kafka Administration and Monitoring UI Tools](https://hackernoon.com/kafka-administration-and-monitoring-ui-tools-ksr2tta)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/csyp2t26.png)
Kafka itself comes with command line tools that can do all the 
administration tasks, but those tools aren’t very convenient because 
they are not integrated into one tool and you need to run a different 
tool for different tasks. Moreover, it is getting difficult to work with them when your clusters grow large or when you have several clusters.

Designing a data pipeline comes with its own set of problems. Take lambda architecture for example. In the batch layer, if data somewhere in the past is incorrect, you’d have to run the computation function on the whole (possibly terabytes large) dataset, the result of which would be absorbed in serving layer and are reflected.

### [29. Lambda Architecture Batch Layer: Visualizing All Time Taxi Data [Part 3]](https://hackernoon.com/lambda-architecture-batch-layer-visualizing-all-time-taxi-data-part-3-n74l31lq)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/oJcyiih3JxQIYnSJChKYcEE1zXE3-jc693w8f.jpeg)
In this part i would be talking about the batch layer of the Lambda Architecture. Batch layer is computed by applying a function to the whole historical dataset, to answer some high level questions which cannot be answered by either speed layer or serving layer. The computations typically take hours or days to run, and the results are stored usually in a distributed file system (although this is not a requirement). For example, the queries that might need to be answered would range from the beginning of the dataset to now, in our case, till date how many cabs have served how many passengers, or what is the total distance driven by all the cabs. In this article i would try to answer questions like these based on the dataset that i have. The code for the article can be found here.

Technical design. Because one of the most common use cases of the new databases is storing data that is generated by high-throughput sources, it is important that the store engine is able to handle write-intensive workloads, all while offering acceptable read performance. RocksDB implements what is known in the database literature as a log-structured merge tree aka LSM tree.

Running systems in production involve requirements for high availability, resilience and recovery from failure. When running cloud-native applications this becomes even more critical, as the base assumption in such environments is that compute nodes will suffer outages, Kubernetes nodes will go down and microservices instances are likely to fail, yet the service is expected to remain up and running.
