If you've used Discord for any amount of time, I'm sure that you've come across at least a few Discord bots. Given MEE6 or Groovy, they all do the same thing and that's add functionality as well as a new way to interact with the platform. This is a fascinating idea as not many other platforms allow you to implement your own modifications. If you look at the Bots job postings on Discord's careers website, you'll see a big part of what they are trying to do with bots is “empower developers” and “give their dev community more ways to express their creativity and build exciting apps”. Let me be the first to tell you, this is exactly what they are doing. By giving people a way to interact with a piece of software that they use every day, it can inspire new and experience developers alike to share and develop their creativity.
