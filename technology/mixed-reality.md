![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/do103y78.gif)
As of now, if you are an intelligent design systems engineer interested in designing, fabricating and assembling a robot for your lab or factory, you must go through the laborious process of first designing a 3D model on a 2D screen (which is problematic without full-scale context) then making a crammed engineering drawing listing the bill of materials and displaying your design in different views (isometric, right, left, section, exploded). For the engineer putting this together, this takes hours to days to do so depending on the complexity of the robot. One must take into account the orientation of every part, measurement of each side and angle, the location of the part in terms of the whole assembly, surfaces that should meet vs not, appropriate torque required for any screws, etc.

When Watson and Crick were figuring out the double helix shape of our DNA, they actually used a set of molecular models, similar to toys used in preschool. Being  able to feel and see them in 3D definitely has  its advantages. And, when it comes to how microscopic entities interact, why leave it all to the imagination? We’ve seen generations of students struggling to understand and remember concepts in chemistry through the written word, most of which is literally Greek. The use of Augmented and Virtual Reality can actually turn chemistry from a dreaded subject to a really cool one.
