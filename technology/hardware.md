Building Information Modelling (BIM) has significantly improved the Architect, Engineer and Construction (AEC) industry with data that saves time and money, reduces error and increases productivity. Although BIM is a powerful process for AEC professionals, it still lacks the ease of collaboration and coordination with stakeholders who are not equipped with in-depth knowledge of BIM software.

Carbon film resistors are a type of film resistor. It uses high-temperature vacuum coating technology to closely attach carbon to the surface of the ceramic rod to form a carbon film. Then appropriate joints are added for cutting, and the surface is coated with epoxy resin for sealing protection. The surface is often painted with green protective paint.

If you’ve been to CES, you know it’s like a sprawling, exhausting rumpus room for tech geeks. You probably saw things you didn’t even believe were possible. And you probably went home overstimulated and mind-blown. But how does the technology extravaganza look to someone who knows tech inside and out, someone who keeps up with each new product as they’re released and developed?

In the competitive display market, developers are in a constant race to elevate the user sensory experience – sight being the most important and discerning of the human senses. As a result, manufacturers thrive by adopting innovative technologies that improve display quality. However, prior to adoption, new technologies must prove their reliability and adherence to the stringent manufacturing requirements of the industry.

For far too long I possessed an old Dell Studio laptop. It served me well for a good 5 years with a number of service centre visits, battery and hard disk replacements, formats and OS upgrades. From the past few years I have ditched the old laptop for a Macbook. Yet still, I never bothered to dispose of it. After all it still works (slow af but works!). <em>What if there is an ‘emergency’ situation where I need to use this ancient piece of technology?</em> I tried selling it, but the act itself and the price I get for it is honestly not worth it. Giving it to someone for free feels like a punishment to the person (most smartphones have better specs). Disposing it off just doesn’t feel right (yeah right! That’s the middle class in me speaking. Also not very good for the environment).

You probably have heard of the idea of out-of-order execution, and that it breaks some common-sense assumptions about writing programs, and software has to insert barriers to make things right. That was a baffling concept to me at least when I heard of it. At the very least, why would the hardware want to execute out of order only to have the software correct the behavior back? What's the point? Is the software taking care of all the quirks for me?  And if not, where's the catch?

Recently, we came across this great paper (link, free PDF) about modeling the impact of multipath on Semtech's LoRa modulation.  Specifically, it models Rayleigh flat fading, which is observed in urban and indoor use-cases.  We had just finished testing LoRaWAN vs. Haystack’s LoRa XR2 in an environment with heavy multipath interference (an airport parking garage).  The results were so one-sided that we wanted to find any research that might either validate our results or, potentially, shed light on something we were doing wrong in the experiment.  Fortunately, we found just the paper, and it corroborates perfectly with the experimental results we achieved.

LCD TVs are unquestionably the most widely recognized TV accessible for buyers nowadays, and, with the end of plasma, most believe that LCD (LED/LCD) TVs are the main sort left.

Home automation comes with plenty of potential to make our lives easier. But in order to succeed in its task, it often requires you to fill your house with bridges that can connect your smart devices to your Wi-Fi network. Unless you buy a smart device that communicates directly over Wi-Fi (like a TP-Link or Belkin smart plug), odds are that many of your favourite smart devices use either Bluetooth, Zigbee or Z-Wave to communicate. These protocols solve some of the issues of Wi-Fi when it comes to smart devices — like latency, centralised topology and relatively high power requirements — but they do require some physical hardware in between to do the smart protocol <-> Wi-Fi translation and make the devices actually controllable from a Wi-Fi-connected client.

In certain cases, new advances open the entryway for dynamic makers to discharge genuinely creative contributions of their own. In the present and future time innovation is going to assume a significant job in human life. Most of the present day students are doing various researches and trying to innovate any device that suite for everyone. As robots and machines are currently being presented in the industry, there are many innovations in progress. Also, these things have decreased human commitment in function, as a result, lessening slip-ups or blunders, which brings about better profitability and great quality work.

Our universe is formed by gradually connecting the matter to form the galaxies and stars after the Big Bang explosion. These fully formed planets and stars are conjoint to create the universe in which the human exists. Similarly, in electronics, each component is linked together to make a circuit, which can establish a connection among the components without any resistance in between the process. The connection should form a closed loop that can keep the devices running.

Firmware is an integral part of any embedded system. A device is more than a combination of components. Without instructions, the microcontrollers do not “know” how to manage the peripherals. But embedded firmware development is not an easy task. It involves not only coding but a lot of testing and debugging as well. Today, we are going to talk about the common challenges of embedded firmware programming and their solutions.
