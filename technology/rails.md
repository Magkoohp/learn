As a student of Microverse, I‚Äôve reached the point where Rails‚Äô framework was introduced to me. It appeared to me with the best omens on its hands. Ruby on Rails is a starting point for many start-ups because all of them got blinded by its beauty and simplicity. I have to admit that I felt intimidated for a while. Surely I can't say we are the best friends now but things started to make sense. Ruby on Rails is designed under the MVC principles - Model View Controllers.

This is a tutorial about how we can implement IBM Cloud Storage in our Ruby on Rails 6 projects. We can upload images and manage these assets with Rails.

Almost any app that we build has a lot of interactive options with a lot of data, to this we can also have conditions to which data should we show to what type of user, making us request data from different tables based on a unique identifier, if the queries are not handled in a proper manner this can slow down the loading, and that is because of the "N + 1" problem.
