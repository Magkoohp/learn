Have you ever tuned in to a video or a TV show and the actors were completely inaudible, or the music was way too loud? Well, this problem, also called the cocktail party problem, may never happen again. Mitsubishi and Indiana University just published a new model as well as a new dataset tackling this task of identifying the right soundtrack. For example, if we take the same audio clip we just ran with the music way too loud, you can simply turn up or down the audio track you want to give more importance to the speech than the music.

Text-to-Image models like DALLE or stable diffusion are really cool and allow us to generate fantastic pictures with a simple text input. But would it be even cooler to give them a picture of you and ask it to turn it into a painting? Imagine being able to send any picture of an object, person, or even your cat, and ask the model to transform it into another style like turning yourself into a cyborg of into your preferred artistic style or adding it to a new scene.

If you thought Dall-e 2 had great results, wait until you see what this new model from Google Brain can do. Dalle-e is amazing but often lacks realism, and this is what the team attacked with this new model called Imagen. They share a lot of results on their project page as well as a benchmark, which they introduced for comparing text-to-image models, where they clearly outperform Dall-E 2, and previous image generation approaches.

We’ve seen AI generate images from other images using GANs. Then, there were models able to generate questionable images using text. In early 2021, DALL-E was published, beating all previous attempts to generate images from text input using CLIP, a model that links images with text as a guide. A very similar task called image captioning may sound really simple but is, in fact, just as complex. It is the ability of a machine to generate a natural description of an image.

You’ve all seen amazing-looking images like these, entirely generated by an artificial intelligence model. I covered multiple approaches on my channel, like Craiyon, Imagen, and the most well-known, Dall-e 2.Most people want to try them and generate images from random prompts, but the majority of these models aren’t open-source, which means we, regular people like us, cannot use them freely. Why? This is what we will dive into in this video...
