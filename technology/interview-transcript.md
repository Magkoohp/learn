There is a lot to take away from the price performance of the digital asset market in 2020. One of such is that the concept of bitcoin halving, as expected, is a major contributing factor to the success of the bitcoin market and has eventually delivered the level of price swings projected during the pre-halving days. Another is that DeFi is perhaps the most potent application of cryptocurrency technology, which makes it the most plausible instigator of the next wave of growth. In the months following the global market crash, the DeFi landscape has attracted around $14 billion worth of capital. Why is this so?

A study by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance recently revealed that there are over 100 million crypto participants worldwide. This revelation is indicative of the crypto market’s growing attractiveness to investors interested in taking advantage of the inflation hedging capacity of Bitcoin and the profitability of DeFi tokens. The digital asset market has established itself as one of the best performing asset classes in 2020. And for this reason, I expect more investors to flock into the space.

Since its origin quite long ago, asset management has been considered a smooth way to effortlessly kick your financial portfolio into gear using a professional’s help. To get it done, people prefer to hire professionals who possess a strong level of financial sensibility and constantly keep their hands on the pulse of the market. Whether you are driven by their competence or your own lack of free time, financial professionals can do all the grunt work for you and in the best cases, end up with returns which exceed initial expectations.

Blockchain provides a wide variety of channels to create or recreate new models for legacy systems. The components of this technology offer disruptive frameworks that can optimize the way we execute transactions and much more. And although financial applications remain the most compelling use case of blockchain, it has registered a similar level of success in the gaming industry. The introduction of CryptoKitties in 2017 showcased just how versatile blockchain is and the enormous demand for blockchain-enabled gaming platforms.

Every crypto practitioner has a unique narrative that has brought him or her face-to-face with the realities of the true innovative power of crypto technology. Perhaps, this notion is the reason why the crypto community has stood by the viability of cryptocurrency all through its trying times. As such, the crypto space has evolved into a network of mavericks who are not only tech-savvy but have learned to appreciate and nurture the business side of the crypto economy.

There are several narratives identified as the propelling factors for the increasing demand for crypto assets. However, the most potent is the “store of value” narrative that has established crypto, most especially bitcoin, as the go-to-asset for investors looking to hedge against inflation. This sentiment trails what experts term as a critical period in human history borne by an unrelenting health crisis and a myriad of flawed economic policies designed to suppress its impact. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, over 17 million Americans will permanently lose their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Hi Dan Schatt, welcome to our series “Behind the Startup” tell us about your journey from the payments industry to decentralized finance (DeFi)?

My “Aha” moment was in 2013 at PayPal. We called ourselves “The Internet of Payments” and had spent so much time plugging into traditional payment and settlement systems around the world, eliminating buyer and seller frictions, as long as they all used PayPal. Moving bits of data is easy when everyone is using the same database.  I thought to myself, I don’t know if it’s 10 years or 20 years, but when distributed ledger technology scales, they will eventually overtake traditional payment networks. We started thinking about what infrastructure would be needed to spur the development of financial services for the “token economy” and that’s eventually how CRED was born!

It is fun to speculate on the price of Bitcoin or whatever your favorite asset is, but the real question for our industry is what value are we delivering to our customers. How are we making their lives better, saving them time or money? If a crypto exchange needs a major bull run in Bitcoin to survive, then they have the wrong business model.

The crypto market has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s whitepaper was conceived 12 years ago, shortly after the U.S Financial Crisis which devastated the global economy. Today, this space enjoys a cool $400 billion in market capitalization with Bitcoin taking the lion share at a 62.4% dominance. Unlike like in the past where Bitcoin was the main narrative, dynamics are now shifting as crypto innovators pivot towards decentralized products and ecosystems.

The crypto industry is currently in a critical growth phase fueled by the influx of institutional traders and intensified engagement with crypto assets. This budding crypto era, connoted by the price rally of digital assets and the explosion of DeFI protocols, coincides with a period of increased uncertainty in a majority of traditional markets. Experts believe that the unbridled spending of governments in the guise of economic relief programs could lead to a catastrophic end. As such, institutional investors are increasingly opting for cryptocurrencies and precious metals to hedge against inflation. According to a report by Fidelity Investments, 36% of the 774 institutional investors surveyed across Europe and America own cryptocurrencies or its derivatives.

During the chaos caused by the global pandemic, P2P, or peer-to-peer, transformed into a growing worldwide movement can no longer be left in shadow. Some experts even regard it as a way to save the global economy from an all-embracive post-pandemic crash. P2P already proved to be advantageous against a traditional exchange model in a number of ways – not least because it allows higher inclusion and can freely function even in countries that do not define cryptocurrency under their jurisdictions. Take an example of India – it is about to embark on the biggest bull rally of all time, and P2P exchanges are the engine behind it. Besides, P2P may be a lifeline for SMEs hit by the economic crash most severely – in conditions where they do not qualify for the bank credit support, P2P may become the only way to bail out.

Crypto’s growing attractiveness stems from digital assets’ unique capacity to eliminate pain-points peculiar to certain industries. Without any doubt, one of the defining successes of crypto in 2019 is the emergence of DeFi technology, especially in the lending and investment market. Together, cryptocurrency and its underlying technology enable lending ecosystems devoid of challenges prevalent in legacy systems. With this setup, lenders can easily invest in the budding crypto lending market, while borrowers can evade the bureaucratic structure of traditional lending facilities and enjoy lesser interest rates.
