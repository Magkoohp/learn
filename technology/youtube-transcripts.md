We’ve seen AI generate images from other images using GANs. Then, there were models able to generate questionable images using text. In early 2021, DALL-E was published, beating all previous attempts to generate images from text input using CLIP, a model that links images with text as a guide. A very similar task called image captioning may sound really simple but is, in fact, just as complex. It is the ability of a machine to generate a natural description of an image.

Well, this problem, also called the cocktail party problem, may never happen again. Mitsubishi and Indiana University just published a new model as well as a new dataset tackling this task of identifying the right soundtrack. For example, if we take the same audio clip we just ran with the music way too loud, you can simply turn up or down the audio track you want to give more importance to the speech than the music.
