![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/0l1iv2a55.png)
Imagine the situation, you have a legacy system partially migrated to multiple services and used by the relatively small amount of  concurrent users. And one day stakeholders want to create an open API and expose the system to external clients with the load significantly higher than the existing system can handle, and it should be scalable to  handle in the future even more.

Imagine you are in the process of migration of a legacy system from the data center to the cloud to make the system scalable. If containerization is not an option you will try cloud-native autoscaling. One of the most commonly used metric to perform autoscaling is CPU utilisation. If your application does not scale well based on this metric this is pretty likely because of more serious issues. Let's see why.

In many cases, custom metrics may be useful to make more ad-hoc configuration of autoscaling in AWS. For example, a custom metric can allow an autoscaling group to react more rapidly on spikes or to take into account the health state of hosts for concurrency based metrics. Let's see how to set up a custom metric and autoscaling policy for an autoscaling group with an application load balancer and target group using AWS Console.

Product manager interviews usually include a section on metrics. As a data scientist at Uber, I’ve often given or helped friends prepare for these interviews. The difference between candidates who crush the metric questions and those who struggle turns, as far as I can tell, on whether they have a framework that they can apply.

Every time facing a task of configuring how the system should scale out and scale in, we decide what metrics and policies will be more effective. I have already described CPU based policies and what challenges they may have. But what if this is not an option, i.e. the service is represented by legacy application, written years ago, not well documented, etc. and we still want to run it in Cloud and autoscale?

Engineering managers are in charge of tech teams. It means there are tens or maybe hundreds of people supporting them. Generally, they need to ensure the best practices around software development, hire and train engineering staff, align and motivate the team towards the company’s goal, manage the team’s performance, and be accountable for all technical decisions.

If you can’t answer it, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Many engineering leaders couldn’t tell you without some significant number-crunching. Gaining visibility into performance is only half the battle though. Knowing how to interpret metrics and how to apply them to improving performance is where the magic happens. Many CEOs do not know how to align engineering metrics to business KPIs (revenue, customer retention, etc.). Bringing metrics to your board or non-technical CEO for the first time may be challenging if you are unable to help them bridge the gap.

On average, a software development team reworks about 26% of its code prior to release. Even after accounting for necessary changes, those wasted hours can cost a medium-sized business upwards of $4.7M a year. 

Still, when engineering leaders look to cut costs, they often look at departmental spending. Software licenses, discretionary expenses, and even salaries may come under scrutiny.

But not all costs come with such a clear price tag — inefficiencies in the software development process are harder to quantify, but much more expensive. 

According to a 2017 DORA white paper, Forecasting the Value of DevOps Transformations, the cost of Rework in software development is staggering, setting businesses of all sizes back millions of dollars a year.

A common architectural design pattern these days is to break up an application monolith into smaller microservices. Each microservice is then responsible for a specific aspect or feature of your app. For example, one microservice might be responsible for serving external API requests, while another might handle data fetching for your frontend.
