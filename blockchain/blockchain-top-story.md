The first time I laid eyes on a cold blockchain wallet, I was stunned. It wasn’t just the novelty of blockchain technology that shocked me, but the inherent vulnerabilities of wallets currently on the market. Where others saw secure pieces of equipment capable of safely storing millions of dollars in digital assets, I saw HSM formats, USB, ethernet cables, QR codes, and SD cards. In other words, I saw weak points that hackers could use to penetrate the wallets’ defenses, including WI-FI and bluetooth connections that made the notion of “air-gapped” computers laughable.

Long before the invention of Bitcoin, the computerized world has become dependent on open source developers. Some pieces of code such as Internet browsers, operating systems, and code libraries have become so essential that it is unanimously agreed upon that they should not be controlled by a single company, who might charge exorbitant fees for their usage, withhold the software from certain users for any reason, or do other nefarious things with the code.

One of the most important aspects of any blockchain network is the consensus algorithm that is used to validate transactions. In centralized systems like Visa and MasterCard, transactions are verified by a host of authorities. On the other hand, in a decentralized system like blockchain, the network nodes need a set of rules to help them arrive at consensus
regarding the authenticity of new transactions. This is where the  consensus algorithm comes in.
