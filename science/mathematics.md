Most programming languages have a Data Type called “Boolean”. This is
a form of data with only two possible values (usually “true” and
“false”). The Ruby language however does not have a Boolean Data
Type.

Today, with open source machine learning software libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras or PyTorch we can create neural network, even with a high structural complexity, with just a few lines of code. Having said that, the Math behind neural networks is still a mystery to some of us and having the Math knowledge behind neural networks and deep learning can help us understand what’s happening inside a neural network. It is also helpful in architecture selection, fine-tuning of Deep Learning models, hyperparameters tuning and optimization.

Modern computers today use a binary number representation system called 'Two's complement'. It is a fixed number of binary digits used in computer calculations. Basic math operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed using the binary rules of addition and subtraction. Two's complement is not a complex scheme and is rather very simple to work with. This system also helps overcome the shortcomings of having to deal with magnitudes. Two's complement can be characterized as:

The factor is the numeral that can easily be divided into other numerals. It is to divide a numeral equally. If we have to divide 6, we are going to use 1, 2, 3, and 6. No other numerals can be used to divide it as they wouldn’t give the one numeral that is equally divisible. Factoring refers to the process of finding numbers so that results would be taken by multiplication. For this, we have to find out the highest common factor then divide it to have the result.
