Security is a ‘state of mind’ and not an end state. It has been a popular philosophical thought, but what it eludes is the fact of investment towards security. IoT has exploded with the onset of new smart tech gadgets. Though businesses today exercise security and safety measures within their organizations, it isn’t easy to keep upgrading an organization’s infrastructure to encompass these technology updates. Reverse engineering systems have always remained the passcode for unlocking backdoors to capitalize on security vulnerabilities. The best example of such a scenario is the 2016 MIRAI botnet attack. The attack caused massive DDoS attacks on large enterprises on Atlanta’s city administration and the ATL airport. IoT still lacks immunity against ransomware attacks and many new age cyberattacks.

If you want to access data in a distributed environment such as in a microservice architecture, then data services are the way to go. The idea is to create a data abstraction layer (DAL) that the rest of the system’s applications and services can share. Thus, a data service gives you a generalized interface to the data you’re exposing and provides access to it in a standard manner. This would be in a well-understood protocol and a known data format. For example, a popular approach is to use JSON via HTTP/S.
