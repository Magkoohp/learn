It’s been over a year since COVID-19 appeared, and it’s still painfully apparent that this crisis is far from over. In fact, it may even trigger the largest economic change since World War Two. According to Arthur D. Little, a management consultancy firm, COVID-19 has been the impetus for an economic shift from a resources-driven to technology-focused economic model, one where the principles of “green” and tech go hand-in-hand. In essence, it will be data, not natural resources, which plays the fundamental role in keeping the global economy running. One possible implication of this is a full-scale transition to a digital economy. Data will be the fuel which powers our lives – and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart technologies will have to hit the ground running.

It’s been over a year since the GDPR came into effect, and at least five since it was first debated seriously. For much of that time it was discussed as a global game-changer, yet the predicted earth-shaking effects of its implementation — billion-dollar fines, the end of data exploitation by rogue firms, high-profile court cases — have largely yet to materialize. Instead, the landscape of the internet has changed in more subtle and complex ways which could not have been predicted by pundits, and it’s affecting businesses of every size.

Stocktwits as a tool really excited me in the beginning, but I was awakened to a reality of things that are quite toxic.

This isn't to personally come after the founders or anything like this, as I warrant a healthy discussion on how to improve big tech. We do need to look at the problems though.

Facebook, Google, Amazon. Everybody seems to be out to get your data. No wonder, monetising data is a massive business that propelled centralised data controllers to the market cap stratosphere. But what do you get for giving away your data? A “free” service, if you are lucky, and a breakdown of democracy if you are fresh out of luck. Consequently, a number of people are pushing the idea that users should control their data using self-sovereign identity (SSI) management systems (like sovrin) and interoperable data pods (such as inrupt). As it turns out, though, this approach has a number of fundamental issues as well.
