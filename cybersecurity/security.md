The fifth generation of mobile communication networks isn’t on its way; it's  already here. You’ve probably heard plenty about 5G in the past few years, as this promising new generation of wireless technology is what’s enabling the continued spread of the internet of things and a host of other digital innovations. Virtually all tech experts agree that 5G technology is a good thing, given that it will lead to faster connectivity and more secure networks. However, there are good reasons to believe that the staggered deployment of 5G technology will mean that it remains vulnerable to a number of security woes currently plaguing 4G technology.

Hashing algorithms are one-way functions. They take any string and turn it into a fixed-length “fingerprint” that is unable to be reversed. This means that if your data in your database is compromised, the hacker cannot get the user’s passwords if they were hashed well because at no point were they ever stored on the drive without being in their hashed form.

Web security is a topic that is often overlooked by frontend developers. When we assess the quality of the website, we often look at metrics like performance, SEO-friendliness, and accessibility, while the website’s capacity to withstand malicious attacks often falls under the radar. And even though the sensitive user data is stored server-side and significant measures must be taken by backend developers to protect the servers, in the end, the responsibility for securing that data is shared between both backend and frontend. While sensitive data may be safely locked in a backend warehouse, the frontend holds the keys to its front door, and stealing them is often the easiest way to gain access.

Security has become an integral part of software development and operations lifecycle. When it comes to web applications, there are well-established patterns and practices to ensure securing the data. Typically most of us consider access control and securing the data at rest and transit for protection. Though these areas are fundamentally important, there are many more things to do to establish overall security of a web application. This article focuses on providing a broader perspective of things, in developing secure software focusing mostly on web applications.

Industries like finance, law, banking and the public sector where culture has traditionally frowned upon working-from-home, are compelled to succumb to such mandates out of necessity. As much rampant the unfortunate layoffs, hiring freezes, and budget cuts across travel and hospitality industries are, data breaches have been on a steady rise. And this is an important observation that we can’t afford to overlook.

Standard authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and one-time passwords work as filters at the entrance of the protected perimeter. But what if someone managed to trick these filters or changed the user after their successful login? Cyber attackers may steal credentials of legitimate users and even one-time passcodes using malware and different phishing techniques. In the companies without special employee monitoring software, employees often nonchalantly share their logins and passwords with colleagues. Finally, there’s always a risk of someone getting a hold of a corporate device such as a laptop or smartphone with full access to the corporate network, critical resources, and applications.

Organizations nowadays are storing and performing computation of the data on the cloud instead of handling themselves. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide these services at an affordable cost and low maintenance. But to ensure compliance and retain privacy, organizations need to transfer the data in an encrypted format, which does ensure the confidentiality of the data. However, once the data reaches the cloud, the CSP has to decrypt the data to perform operation or computation.

If you care about your security on the web, you probably use a Two-Factor authentication (2FA) method to protect your accounts. There are various 2FA methods available out there, a combination of password + fingerprint, for example, is one of them. However, since not so many people have a fingerprint reader available all the time, one of the most popular 2FA methods today is to use an authenticator app on your cellphone to generate a temporary password that expires within a minute or even less. But, how does this temporary password, called Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) works, and how can I implement that on my own service?

Welcome to second part of the DevSecOps  series.  In the second part, we will turn ON/OFF the inbuilt led of ESP32 using AWS Device Shadow Service. Before starting, let's do a recap, in Part 1 we have connected the ESP32 MCU with AWS and able to publish Messages to IoT Core.  The following series split into two parts (refer below) with very simple and clear instructions to provision a CI/CD pipeline adhering to DevSecOps principles in AWS. Everything covered from scratch you won't face any difficulty understanding. In case of any clarification, drop me a note on LinkedIn. Feel free to explore them with ease, skip to the one which is relevant to you.

I like Schlage’s smartlocks, and have used them for years. Built by a company with a long history of making reasonably secure, reliable locks, I’ve used several of their Z-Wave locks over the years, but Z-Wave is…Z-Wave. Proprietary until recently, a PIA to troubleshoot, and while the technology held a lot of promise on paper, in reality it’s been the cause for many a swear word to erupt from my mouth (I realize this is partially due to the controllers I’ve used over the years).

One might think that the internet was designed for the consumer to remain anonymous and share their ideas without any censorship.

DevSecOps is the new buzz and definitely a potential candidate to scare people in the ever-changing software industry. When I heard the term for the first time, my inner voice said it out loud, "When just this Happened, and why SEC is sandwich between them ?". Later on, to look cool, I started adding DevSecOps on my profile, but the dire consequence was a complete disappointment. DevSecOps isn't just restricted to understand security by heart & fit it with DevOps. A good analogy would be not to imagine your ex with someone, especially with your girlfriend/wife. It is all about "Shift left on Security" i.e. to introduce security as early as possible in the SDLC. Though I am not going to bore you with the definitions and concepts as I am a practical person. Thus, my objective here is to demonstrate how DevSecOps works in reality. The following series split into two parts (refer below) with very simple and clear instructions to provision a CI/CD pipeline adhering to DevSecOps principles in AWS. Everything covered from scratch you won't face any difficulty understanding. In case of any clarification, drop me a note on LinkedIn.

Staying safe on the internet has grown harder over the past few years as both technology and hackers have developed. Recently though, hackers are gaining an edge by not just manipulating the tech, but by manipulating the users themselves. In 2018, weak or stolen passwords were tied to over 80% of security breaches and in 2019, there were over 150,000 security incidents and nearly 4,000 confirmed data breaches. In 2020 alone, more than 15 billion stolen credentials were up for sale on the dark web. All this data points out the fact that our current way of protecting data is flawed, but making a new way to protect it while still maintaining security and convenience is a high mark to hit.

As we adjust to life during a pandemic, two things have become clear: First, the internet is essential; second,  the internet is full of dangers. Each of these dangers is different: They vary in the sort of attack they strike with, our familiarity with them, and the tools we can use to avert them. For example, viruses have been well-known for decades. Every PC is currently protected with antivirus software--and in many cases, it’s incorporated right into your operating system. Other types of internet threats, such as botnets, are newer, more difficult to detect, and less known to web users.

The story of event logging begins at sea and is related to navigation. One of the important aspects of navigation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning" target="_blank">dead reckoning</a>: estimating your current position based on course, speed and time from a known, observed point. In the end of 15th century, speed at sea was measured with a small wooden log. A so-called ‘Dutchman’s Log’ was dropped overboard from the bow of the ship and the navigator measured the time elapsing before it passed the stern.
