![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/3nhao37bBEfHA9RTQ0WNVWfXPD02-fc1w316i.jpeg)
Organizations nowadays are storing and performing computation of the data on the cloud instead of handling themselves. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide these services at an affordable cost and low maintenance. But to ensure compliance and retain privacy, organizations need to transfer the data in an encrypted format, which does ensure the confidentiality of the data. However, once the data reaches the cloud, the CSP has to decrypt the data to perform operation or computation.

### [17. End-to-End Encryption Basics](https://hackernoon.com/end-to-end-encryption-basics-9s973yul)

Imagine, you are messaging your business partner about a super secret idea, it is worth $ 1m, will you trust the messaging application not to read your super secret conversation? No, right. No one will, still people across the world use whatsapp for such sensitive messaging (although I prefer telegram for my secret conversations). Well, turns out, it is because most messaging apps(including whatsapp) use a technique called End to End Encryption, which doesn’t allow these messaging services or their employees to read your conversations with your contacts. But how does this works, well, that is what we will try to understand here.

We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.

Being concerned with the security of online communication and information exchange is absolutely OK. It is a reflection of the fact that you
are aware of global surveillance happening every second of our presence online. Our online activities are monitored, intercepted, collected, and stored. And now imagine that what you know is only the small fraction of what is really happening with our information.

Encryption makes the digital world work. It consists of a few elegant math equations that scramble data before being sent over the internet where prying eyes could otherwise intercept it, read it, and manipulate it. Encryption is the reason everything from financial transactions to state secrets get passed around the internet nearly instantaneously, unlocking massive amounts of innovation, wealth, and prosperity as a result.

Complacency with privacy invasion has become our 6th sense. Handing over the intimate details of our lives to corporate and government stooges has become a virtue and civic duty. It should come as no surprise that, even for a society dripping with tech-savviness, the average person would rather their government act than to take action themselves. According to Pew Research:

Web certificates are a foundational element of website security, enabling organizations to verify that the web address in question really does belong to them, as well as to keep users secure by encrypting their information. These certificates have become ubiquitous, and most savvy web users now know to look for the telltale indicators of a valid web certificate, which may include a closed padlock or green address bar, depending on the browser used.

A few companies I've worked for have an IT policy on their secure computers designed to stop movement of sensitive data outside the enterprise. This policy encrypts all file data being written to removable media (USB drives, external hard drives, etc.) such that only  a computer within the same enterprise can decrypt and read the data.
