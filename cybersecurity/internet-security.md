More than two thirds of the U.S. population is now stuck at home as more states are creating new restrictions to try to slow the spread of COVID-19. The internet is now being used more than ever as millions are turning to it as an alternative source of social connection, work, and entertainment. In Seattle, one of the cities in the U.S. that was hardest hit by the virus, internet traffic quickly began to rise - from January to March it has risen by an astounding 30%. Other U.S. ISPs are noticing huge spikes in WiFi calling, online gaming, and VPN usage across the country. With a huge number of increased active users, governments and companies alike are making moves to help Americans stay online. One of these steps is the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge that over 70 telecom companies have signed stating that these companies will waive late fees and retain service even with lack of payment. Other companies are making public WiFi networks for students and remote workers. Comcast is setting up public hotspots for free use, Comcast and Spectrum are both offering 2 free months of access to low-income families, and AT&T is suspending broadband usage caps.

ERP systems are complex solutions that handle business-critical processes and manage sensitive data. These factors alone are enough to make them an attractive target for cybercriminals. Despite it being common knowledge, businesses often opt for simpler and cheaper solutions that do not address the issue at the system level. Below is an in-depth look at the main factors that erode corporate cybersecurity and ways to prevent cyberattacks.

We live our lives online these days – and given this simple fact, it should come as no surprise that cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing industries around, and one that’s critical to all other sectors. For those in the cryptocurrency industry, however, cybersecurity plays a more interesting role. That’s because, while cryptocurrency operations clearly need to enhance their own cybersecurity efforts, they’re also reliant on technology – blockchain – that other industries are using for their own security needs.

Trying to find the best VPN can be a daunting task, especially when there are so many to choose from. While free VPNs might seem like an easy way to dive into better security and bypass content locks, many of them are also likely to steal information and leave users in worse spots than they already were. Not every free VPN does this, but those wishing to truly be secure online will be much more comfortable with a paid service. Luckily, some of the best VPN services come with a free trial, and users would do very well to take advantage of them.

In 2019, more than 627 million online records were comprised due to hacking and other types of cyber attacks. This is a pretty staggering number to anyone who has made an online transaction, but the amount of attacks that were stopped is much higher, so it’s worth some optimism. As COVID-19 has pushed many companies into the remote work world, online transactions and records are growing exponentially, and most experts believe that remote work will continue to be very popular even after stay-at-home orders get lifted and life goes back to some form of normal.

As we adjust to life during a pandemic, two things have become clear: First, the internet is essential; second,  the internet is full of dangers. Each of these dangers is different: They vary in the sort of attack they strike with, our familiarity with them, and the tools we can use to avert them. For example, viruses have been well-known for decades. Every PC is currently protected with antivirus software--and in many cases, it’s incorporated right into your operating system. Other types of internet threats, such as botnets, are newer, more difficult to detect, and less known to web users.
