Every action on the network leaves a digital footprint. For example, photos we post on social networks, statements on forums, likes and dislikes of videos. Moreover, a user activity leaves a digital trace - information about the sites browsed, purchases made, and geographical locations visited. There are many channels through which our personal data is exposed and the effects of abuse are very serious. Therefore, you should always be extremely careful about the use of world wide web and private data management.

Today’s modern world is, undoubtedly, not a safe haven for any business. Make no mistake, even running a small-time operation or setting up a niche venture can become challenging. But surprisingly enough, the major brands like Sony or top cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance aren’t under the greatest threat - criminals and hackers mostly see their prey under a much lower grade. Network security is one of the stumbling stones for businesses of any scale nowadays. Digital age fraudsters rarely engage in assaulting the top corporations - the largest chunk of their bounty comes from the companies that would never make it to the Forbes list.
