Moreover, a user activity leaves a digital trace - information about the sites browsed, purchases made, and geographical locations visited. There are many channels through which our personal data is exposed and the effects of abuse are very serious. Therefore, you should always be extremely careful about the use of world wide web and private data management.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/1yuf73tpt.jpg)
We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.
