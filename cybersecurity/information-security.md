![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/sk11032ye.png)
This article is about my journey to understand the current practice of de-anonymization via the clickjacking technique whereby a malicious website is able to uncover the identity of a visitor, including his full name and possibly other personal information. I don’t present any new information here that isn’t already publicly available, but I do look at how easy it is to compromise a visitor’s privacy and reveal his identity, even when he adheres to security best practices and uses an up-to-date browser and operating system.

Staying safe on the internet has grown harder over the past few years as both technology and hackers have developed. Recently though, hackers are gaining an edge by not just manipulating the tech, but by manipulating the users themselves. In 2018, weak or stolen passwords were tied to over 80% of security breaches and in 2019, there were over 150,000 security incidents and nearly 4,000 confirmed data breaches. In 2020 alone, more than 15 billion stolen credentials were up for sale on the dark web. All this data points out the fact that our current way of protecting data is flawed, but making a new way to protect it while still maintaining security and convenience is a high mark to hit.

Businesses and personal users alike, cybersecurity is a growing necessity. With the increase of breaches, cybercrime, and more sophisticated hackers in this world, it is more important than ever to ensure that your data and network are secure and safe from criminals. If you are a business, then you likely have a dedicated IT team that helps ensure the safety of the data and network at your business, but it is important for you to understand what needs to be done so you can better direct your IT department. If you are a personal user, never believe that your data and online security is not valuable, as it most often is just as valuable as your physical possessions. Just as there are steps to prevent intestinal permeability, there are steps that can be taken to prevent someone from hacking your information.

The notion of “Zero Trust” has been around since the 90s. But, the Zero Trust security model was first coined by John Kindervag to describe stricter access control management and cybersecurity programs, in 2010. Meaning that infinite trust is diminished from all computing infrastructure, and Zero Trust is grounded on the idea “trust none, verify all”.

We use passwords to access personal information and user accounts. With so many applications requiring passwords (e.g. online banking, shopping and social media just to name a few), it can be hard to track and at worst remember. Some applications require users to change their passwords every so often, and that can lead to users forgetting them or getting careless by writing down their password on a piece of paper. That piece of paper can later be misplaced which can lead to worse things. The problem with requiring frequent password changes and applying complexity to passwords is that it can become more complicated for users.

SIEM stands for "Security Information and Event Management". It is a set of tools and services that offer a holistic view of any organisation's information security. It works by combining two technologies: Security information Management(SIM), which collects data from the log files and runs an analysis on the security vulnerabilities and reports them, and Security Event Management(SEM) which monitors any system on a areal-time basis and also keeps the network admins notified about the threats. SIEM is used to identify threats and anomalies in the network, cyber attacks from gigs of data.
