There are few games that manage to reach the extremely fast pace of WarioWare. This series collects many extremely short minigames, combining them into one big package of rapidly-changing fun. Though it stars Wario as the titular character, these games have little to do with his platformer titles or even his long-time rival Mario. Instead, he simply provides the groundwork for wacky minigames players wouldn’t find anywhere else. That just makes it more interesting to see how well all WarioWare games are ranked amongst themselves in terms of copies sold. After all, these games are popular for more reasons than brand recognition.

Star Fox is a series that has suffered from bad luck after its first few releases, much like the Wario Land games. Though there are still many fans of the action-packed space battles found within, some games focused too much on experimental features while others suffered from a lack of innovation. Currently, there’s no word on if or how the series will continue from here. But the unfortunate decline of the franchise doesn’t erase its previous successes. It’s still possible to look back on how all Star Fox games are ranked amongst each other based on copies sold, which can give a pretty good idea as to what worked and what fell flat.

A goal that you set yourself is more powerful than a goal that is set for you.

Over this current and passing generation of gaming consoles, we've witnessed the rise of the almighty live service game. What I like to think of as the AAA adaptation of mobile gaming mechanics and MMO hits like World of Warcraft, wrapped in a blockbuster console game setting. Player retention, daily logins, battle passes - buzzwords that are part and parcel with the Games as a Service business model permeate throughout these titles that vie for our hard-earned time and money.

To quote a good friend - the "ecosystem" has become the dirtiest word in the industry, with developers and publishers alike looking for ways to keep players engaged long-term. What started with the odd PC only expansion model in the 90's, blossomed into DLC, Season Passes and now Games as a Service. A system that consists of some sort of persistent online world, a gameplay loop designed to be engaging (usually) with constant daily events, new loot and bigger content drops that add new wrinkles every so often. All with the intent of keeping players engaged for years.

It’s interesting to note how far that love runs, which is why this article will take a look at all Wario Land games ranked by the number of copies they sold.
