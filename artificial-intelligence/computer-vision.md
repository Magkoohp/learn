When a human sees an object, certain neurons in our brain’s visual cortex light up with activity, but when we take hallucinogenic drugs, these drugs overwhelm our serotonin receptors and lead to the distorted visual perception of colours and shapes. Similarly, deep neural networks that are modelled on structures in our brain, stores data in huge tables of numeric coefficients, which defy direct human comprehension. But when these neural network’s activation is overstimulated (virtual drugs), we get phenomenons like neural dreams and neural hallucinations. Dreams are the mental conjectures that are produced by our brain when the perceptual apparatus shuts down, whereas hallucinations are produced when this perceptual apparatus becomes hyperactive. In this blog, we will discuss how this phenomenon of hallucination in neural networks can be utilized to perform the task of image inpainting.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/557oYHzCMLNnS8E8PEna6I86yN53-q2237ao.jpeg)
Last year we saw NeRF, NeRV, and other networks able to create 3D models and small scenes from images using artificial intelligence. Now, we are taking a small step and generating a bit more complex models: whole cities. Yes, you’ve heard that right, this week’s paper is about generating city-scale 3D scenes with high-quality details at any scale. It works from satellite view to ground-level with a single model. How amazing is that?! We went from one object that looked okay to a whole city in a year! What’s next!? I can’t even imagine.

You've most certainly seen movies like the recent Captain Marvel or Gemini Man where Samuel L Jackson and Will Smith appeared to look like they were much younger. This requires hundreds if not thousands of hours of work from professionals manually editing the scenes he appeared in. Instead, you could use a simple AI and do it within a few minutes.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/kw2n3v3z.png)
In the spring of 1993, a Harvard statistics professor named Donald Rubin sat down to write a paper. Rubin’s paper would go on to change the way that artificial intelligence is researched and practiced, but its stated goal was more modest: analyze data from the 1990 U.S. census, while preserving the anonymity of its respondents. 

### [179. ShaRF: Create a 3D Model of an Object Using Just a Single Image](https://hackernoon.com/sharf-create-a-3d-model-of-an-object-using-just-a-single-image-ot4933xq)

### [183. Unwrapping Wine Labels - How We Trained A Neural Network To Do It](https://hackernoon.com/unwrapping-wine-labels-how-we-trained-a-neural-network-to-do-it-291r3x6j)
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FN1IRbPItNzNv9lMZnlj7EQkNI7s1-z77n2uwz.jpeg?alt=media&token=995390a8-2f95-48eb-82ad-45fffefa8dc7)
In the previous article, it was described a six-point method to unwrap wine labels. Finding anchor points were performed with Hough transform. It gave fair results for good labels, but for many real cases it was quite unstable, and the efforts to tune it didn’t help much. It became clear at some point, Hough transform itself wasn’t capable of handling the variety of label forms, so the next step was training a neural network.

### [184. Meta's Groundbreaking AI Film Maker: Make-A-Scene](https://hackernoon.com/metas-groundbreaking-ai-film-maker-make-a-scene)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/557oYHzCMLNnS8E8PEna6I86yN53-v593k0h.gif.webp)
Meta AI’s new model make-a-video is out and in a single sentence: it generates videos from text. It’s not only able to generate videos, but it’s also the new state-of-the-art method, producing higher quality and more coherent videos than ever before!

Have you ever dreamed of taking the style of a picture, like this cool TikTok drawing style on the left, and applying it to a new picture of your choice? Well, I did, and it has never been easier to do. In fact, you can even achieve that from only text and can try it right now with this new method and their Google Colab notebook available for everyone (see references).

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/aaxs3yib.jpg)
Stores are changing. We see it happening before our eyes, even if we don’t always realize it. Little by little, they are becoming just one extra step in an increasingly complex customer journey. Thanks to digitalisation and retail automation, the store is no longer an end in itself, but a mean of serving the needs of the brand at large. The quality of the experience, a feeling of belonging and recognition, the comfort of the purchase… all these parameters now matter as much as sales per square meter, and must therefore submit themselves to the optimizations prescribed by Data Science and its “intelligent algorithms” (aka artificial Intelligence in the form of machine learning and deep learning).

Neural networks gave us a powerful and cheap-to-use tool for solving problems of forecasting, computer vision, and text analysis. However, at the same time, they brought the problem of inaccuracy, which is presented as the “norm” and “black box” for deep networks, the derivation of which is difficult to understand and improve.

PyTorch has sort of became one of the de facto standard for creating Neural Networks now, and I love its interface. Yet, it is somehow a little difficult for beginners to get a hold of.

### [196. BlobGAN: A BIG step for GANs](https://hackernoon.com/blobgan-a-big-step-for-gans)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/557oYHzCMLNnS8E8PEna6I86yN53-3ja3fg0.gif.webp)
BlobGAN allows for unreal manipulation of images, made super easily controlling simple blobs. All these small blobs represent an object, and you can move them around or make them bigger, smaller, or even remove them, and it will have the same effect on the object it represents in the image. This is so cool!

Part of the broader artificial intelligence and computer vision realms, human pose estimation (HPE) technology has been gradually making its presence seen in all kinds of software apps and hardware solutions. Still, human pose estimation seemed to be stuck at the edge, failing to cross into mainstream adoption.

We’ve seen AI generate images from other images using GANs. Then, there were models able to generate questionable images using text. In early 2021, DALL-E was published, beating all previous attempts to generate images from text input using CLIP, a model that links images with text as a guide. A very similar task called image captioning may sound really simple but is, in fact, just as complex. It is the ability of a machine to generate a natural description of an image.
