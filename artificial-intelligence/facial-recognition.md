The travel industry has been transformed by the use of facial detection algorithms streamlining processes and reducing hassle at different checkpoints. Airports, train stations and hotels have done away with long cues that required people to submit identity documentation and have them manually verified by officials. The whole process is being humanised by minimizing security processes and make the airport experience smoother.

Voice is one of several unique, innate, and immutable biometric identifiers. Other identifiers include retinal scans, iris scans and facial geometry scans. As technology evolves, so does the public’s concern regarding issues of privacy. Consider, for example, the turmoil DNA evidence introduced to our legal system in the late 1990’s, or, the controversial introduction of fingerprint evidence in the 1910 murder trial of Clarence Hiller in Chicago, Illinois.
