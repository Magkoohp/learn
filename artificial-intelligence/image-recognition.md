![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/8hl72y7a.png)
An image labeling or annotation tool is used to label the images for bounding box object detection and segmentation. It is the process of highlighting the images by humans. They have to be readable for machines. With the help of the image labeling tools, the objects in the image could be labeled for a specific purpose. The process of object labeling makes it easy for people to understand what is in the image. The labeling tool helps the people to mark the items in an image. There are several image labeling tools for object detection, and some of them use varied techniques for detection of the object, like a semantic, bounding box, key-point, cuboid, semantic and many more. In this article, we will talk about image labeling and the best image labeling tools.

CDC officially recommends wearing face masks (even though not everyone complies). Meanwhile, governments in European countries like Spain, Ukraine, or certain regions in Italy require everyone, big or small, to wear masks all the time, when shopping, walking a dog, or plainly going outside. Breaking the requirements could result in a hefty fine.

In the previous article, it was described a six-point method to unwrap wine labels. Finding anchor points were performed with Hough transform. It gave fair results for good labels, but for many real cases it was quite unstable, and the efforts to tune it didn’t help much. It became clear at some point, Hough transform itself wasn’t capable of handling the variety of label forms, so the next step was training a neural network.
