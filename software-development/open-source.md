At first I was a little overwhelmed when I approached the Firefox-voice repository because I had very little experience working with such a large codebase, the code base with a lot of people making contributions. I had to spend a lot of time to setting up communication, running the project locally (with the help of project Readme). I had to spend a very good amount of time understanding the directories, and how to set up the Project on my local machine just to get the application to run. It was really challenging to get this project running at first, I was about to give up but again thanks to the mentor for a fine readme which was helpful in setting this project up and running. As a beginner or someone not familiar with the terms and project niche, it was really hard for me to understand the actual purpose of the project.

In the original days of the new software stack evolution, there was a fringe section which consisted of developers getting together in old fashioned chat rooms, offline and online, and coding for the love of it. When Linus Torvalds started the project to create a new operating system it was a way of community activation. Back in university, open source wasn't known as such, Linux wasn't the paragon of open source, instead it was a good enough version that allowed one to not pay for Microsoft Windows.

The Renaissance was one of the most culturally, artistically, and scientifically significant transformations in Western history. It was an age of experimentation and innovation as cataloged by da Vinici‚Äôs numerous sketches and notebooks. A hallmark of this period of creation that mirrors today is a culture of sharing, and we see that in both times, innovators benefited from spaces and mediums to explore, share, and build upon each other. It seems in these places that fantastic innovation occurs seemingly out of thin air, but it‚Äôs not magic ‚Äì innovation is an iterative process filled with fits and starts, catalyzed by the ability to share and build upon each other‚Äôs work. It defined the Renaissance and it will define our age.

The Open Source movement, as championed by the OSI, prizes absolute openness above all other concerns. Openness, they claim, is an absolute good, from which all other virtues flow, not to be questioned or criticized. It doesn‚Äôt matter if that openness enables evil in the world, without openness we cannot have truly collaborative software development communities. So the claim goes.

We wouldn't be where we're at without the technological progress and innovation from so many other people, projects and organizations.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/gv93oOBCpSQa2kRIURhv0A8fVP33-n11633ax.png)
DevSecOps is the new buzz and definitely a potential candidate to scare people in the ever-changing software industry. When I heard the term for the first time, my inner voice said it out loud, "When just this Happened, and why SEC is sandwich between them ?". Later on, to look cool, I started adding DevSecOps on my profile, but the dire consequence was a complete disappointment. DevSecOps isn't just restricted to understand security by heart & fit it with DevOps. A good analogy would be not to imagine your ex with someone, especially with your girlfriend/wife. It is all about "Shift left on Security" i.e. to introduce security as early as possible in the SDLC. Though I am not going to bore you with the definitions and concepts as I am a practical person. Thus, my objective here is to demonstrate how DevSecOps works in reality. The following series split into two parts (refer below) with very simple and clear instructions to provision a CI/CD pipeline adhering to DevSecOps principles in AWS. Everything covered from scratch you won't face any difficulty understanding.¬†In case of any clarification,¬†drop me a note on LinkedIn.

Many people wonder what the point of open source is? For those who don't get it, they think it is giving stuff out for free. They don't understand how BeagleBone exploded the way they did. More importantly, they don't seem to understand that the internet as we know it, or many innovations in terms of the modern world, wouldn't exist or be the same if it wasn't for open source. Even when you look at proprietary tech companies like Apple, one can argue figures such as Steve Wozniak were greatly inspired by the open hardware movement many decades ago.

Migrating Presto workloads from a fully on-premise environment to cloud infrastructure has numerous benefits, including alleviating resource contention and reducing costs by paying for computation resources on an on-demand basis. In the case of Presto running on data stored in HDFS, the separation of compute in the cloud and storage on-premises is apparent since Presto‚Äôs architecture enables the storage and compute components to operate independently. The critical issue in this hybrid environment of Presto in the cloud retrieving HDFS data from an on-premise environment is the network latency between the two clusters.
