![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/fLIHbAQSSQTWfUaTSfwt)
The Renaissance was one of the most culturally, artistically, and scientifically significant transformations in Western history. It was an age of experimentation and innovation as cataloged by da Vinici’s numerous sketches and notebooks. A hallmark of this period of creation that mirrors today is a culture of sharing, and we see that in both times, innovators benefited from spaces and mediums to explore, share, and build upon each other. It seems in these places that fantastic innovation occurs seemingly out of thin air, but it’s not magic – innovation is an iterative process filled with fits and starts, catalyzed by the ability to share and build upon each other’s work. It defined the Renaissance and it will define our age.

At first I was a little overwhelmed when I approached the Firefox-voice repository because I had very little experience working with such a large codebase, the code base with a lot of people making contributions. I had to spend a lot of time to setting up communication, running the project locally (with the help of project Readme). I had to spend a very good amount of time understanding the directories, and how to set up the Project on my local machine just to get the application to run. It was really challenging to get this project running at first, I was about to give up but again thanks to the mentor for a fine readme which was helpful in setting this project up and running. As a beginner or someone not familiar with the terms and project niche, it was really hard for me to understand the actual purpose of the project.

We have gone through an era in which software and the Internet have devoured the world, and now we are all enjoying the convenience brought by software and the Internet. After returning for a few years, we can not imagine that express delivery is so convenient now, and takeaway is so convenient, everything is completely different from before. Even when we went out for tourism, a new model Airbnb or short-term rental appeared. In the old days, few people could imagine that there are so many people who rent out their free houses or even rooms for tourists. This was impossible to imagine before the prosperity of the Internet and software.

Managing data-flows can be quite tricky in javascript. A pattern that really fascinated me over the last years is the flux architecture from facebook. Especially the redux implementation. But redux just tells you how to store your data and how to update the state. It’s really liberal in how to manage data-flows. So really awesome data-flow middleware libs where born like redux-saga and redux-observable.

In the original days of the new software stack evolution, there was a fringe section which consisted of developers getting together in old fashioned chat rooms, offline and online, and coding for the love of it. When Linus Torvalds started the project to create a new operating system it was a way of community activation. Back in university, open source wasn't known as such, Linux wasn't the paragon of open source, instead it was a good enough version that allowed one to not pay for Microsoft Windows.
