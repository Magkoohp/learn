More importantly, they don't seem to understand that the internet as we know it, or many innovations in terms of the modern world, wouldn't exist or be the same if it wasn't for open source.

System testing is one of the stages of the whole software system testing lifecycle (STLC), which comprises three others: unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing. Each of these stages has their objectives and technical features. This article dedicated to one of the most volumetric phases.So system testing is a software testing which executing on an accomplished integrated system with a purpose to find out if the structure, functional, data and other issues comply with initial stakeholders’ requirements. The main goal of executing this fraction is to checkup functional, as well as non-functional requirements in the system on the whole. Herewith testers detecting such defects as the wrong usage of system resources, unexpected combinations at the user level, incompatibility with an environment, unintended scenarios, absence of functionality or its’ incorrect performance and ect.Let’s have a simple example for a better understanding of how does this testing phase is executing. Imagine you are an electric guitar manufacturer. Electric guitar consists of many details such as fretboard, tunes, body, volume/tone controls, electronic fillings etc. Let’s say you completed chips and boards installation into the guitar body. Each of them has exact functions and resemble, in our case, separate units. But altogether, this units shape an integration system. In order to make sure they work properly you run a test-drive. So, actually, this verification procedure of integration system calls system testing. It shall be carried out on a systematic basis during the construction process to avoid unexpected surprise on the final chord. There is a big chance that off-color element in the very beginning stage of the whole product development lifecycle can roll back entire project.Within system testing stage the following types of tests should be executed:

Many businesses have a process they undergo before the products are shipped off to stores across the country or globe – it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, but software QA is much the same.

New challengers such as the E-Mail client Superhuman or the note-taking tool Roam Research can compete by developing highly opinionated products which deliberately omit flexibility. Instead, the software is stringently crafted around a very particular way of approaching a process, which is inherently seen as superior by the firm.

When I wrote "Your Developer is not a Single Point of Failure" there was definitely push back from managers, suits and other C-Suite denizens. Without a doubt, developers can be single points of failure. I would be lying, if I did not acknowledge the "historical blame" lies mostly at the feet of developers for the belief coders are single points of failure. Too many software developers built ivory towers of code for the sake of job security. Too many businesses were held hostage to custom algorithms only a handful of people could decipher...perhaps only ONE person could!

As software engineers, we strive to better our craft and leave a lasting mark on the organizations we work for. Throughout our careers, we balance two types of knowledge: the combination of business domain and technical stack is our bread and butter. Sometimes we might value the business domain over the technical stack and vice versa as we expand our toolkit. For example, we might work at a financial institution (let’s call it Acme Investment Bank) for a broad domain, but where the tech stack is not bleeding edge. On the other hand, we might roll the dice and work for a firm that has a bleeding-edge tech stack but where the domain is very specific, like a company that sells wine to your pets.

﻿OCR - or in other words, optical character recognition - software allows users to easily convert pictures into the text. You can use the same software to convert handwriting into the text as well. What OCR software actually does is that it analyses a given document, and then it compares it with the already stored fonts in the database. The best part about using OCR software is that it will run the document through a spell checker as well to recognize words that are unrecognizable. The software won't guarantee
100% accuracy; however, it focuses on the close approximation.

In more detail, the questions were about my views regarding the strategic implications for value creation, business model development, pricing strategies, and when to start thinking about these implications. Because the question came up almost a dozen times, and I can only process so much coffee, I decided to write it down in this mini-blog about a phenomenon which is called XaaS, Anything as a Service.

Let me tell you a simple truth. Billing & invoicing is a pain. It has always been. Remember the pre-computer era of accounting? I am talking about the time when companies used to hire accountants and data entry operators to manually maintain billing & invoicing records in heavy files. The process was hectic. It took days and sometimes weeks to create invoices, send them out, and following up on unpaid bills. Above this, it could also cost a lot of time and money.
