Last month, I launched the app on Show HN. As a result, it got 82 points and 78 comments. Ranked in the toppest 10 of popular posts in a day also. Actually, we have pros and cons about it and people tend to criticize it more. Anyway, it felt so amazing that a lot of the people across the world visited my website and said hi to me. What an exciting moment! Today, I‚Äôd like to share how to develop and launch a landing page.

Let‚Äôs take a look at a classic example of a situation that I have observed numerous times. An enthusiastic maker has an idea for a great product and starts building right away without checking for competitors, creating a landing page first or getting some feedback from potential users. The maker sits down in front of his computer and starts building his product blindly.

The curse of being a student is having a huge amount of educational fees unless you are sponsored by someone.

The month of May has been a fairly crazy one. It started out like any other, with me trying to come up with a decent, catchy name for my latest side project that still had an available domain name associated with it. Since it was a tech-related startup, I was considering top-level domains (TLDs) like .ai, .io, .co, and .com.

Hey, everyone! We, the Indie Hackers SPB Community, organized a one-week Bootcamp: in our free time, we built a product from scratch and launched it on Product Hunt. We got the¬†#3 Product of the Day¬†badge and over¬†30 installs of our app in the Slack Workspaces. Now, I want to share our experience. At the end of this article, I will share our¬†Notion checklist, that we found extremely helpful for the launch preparation¬†:)

![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/SFW9h62lTqHjTNTJorlg)
2,281 days ago Product Hunt launched as a tiny newsletter. The early days were especially chaotic. I didn‚Äôt get much sleep, skipped the gym, and buried my head into work. While unsustainable (I'm not advocating overworking yourself!), it was sooo fun and energizing to build something brand new. It was also scary. New products ‚Äì especially those driven by community ‚Äì are incredibly fragile.

7 days ago we launched a beta of YourStack (with a¬†grammatically incorrect, non-editable tweet¬†‚Äì lol). Instantly those same nostalgic feelings from the early days of Product Hunt re-emerged. The response has been very encouraging. Alex was kind enough to¬†write about it on BuzzFeed. Lucas followed with a¬†story on TechCrunch. And a bunch of folks shared support on Twitter and¬†Product Hunt.

But the product is very early and our roadmap is deep. So far we've onboarded only ~4% of those that have signed up as we build tooling to scale (thanks for all your patience!). I wake up each morning nervous but excited to read your feedback and wild ideas as the team and I continue building.

If you get a chance, create your account and start stacking. We're whitelisting new friendly folks each day.

Feedback? I'd love to hear it at¬†ryan@yourstack.com.

Cheers,
Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover)
