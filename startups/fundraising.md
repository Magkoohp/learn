A new study released today challenges the misperception that taking on Out-of-State capital drives more attractive valuations and better business outcomes for founders. The study, titled¬†‚ÄúIs all Investment Capital the Same Shade of Green?,‚Äù draws on data from the Atlanta Technology Development Center (‚ÄúATDC‚Äù) to understand the deal dynamics and outcomes of companies in the ATDC incubator program that accepted capital from In-State versus Out-of-State equity providers from 2014 to 2019. In the study, ‚ÄúIn-State‚Äù represents companies that included investors that reside in the state of Georgia, and ‚ÄúOut-of-State‚Äù represents companies that raised capital entirely from investors based outside of Georgia.

When friends Jessica Rolph and Rod Morris partnered to launch Lovevery in 2015, the two founders already had massive success stories under their belts.¬†

Jessica previously had a successful exit from organic baby food company Happy Family, which she founded. Rod helped take SaaS utility platform Opower public as part of the company‚Äôs leadership team.

Despite their wealth of past experience, Jessica and Rod had plenty to learn when fundraising for Lovevery, a subscription business that puts sustainable, science-backed play kits into the hands of parents. As parents themselves, Jessica and Rod knew their idea had legs when they began working on it ‚Äî¬†but they still felt ‚Äúvery vulnerable‚Äù during the fundraising process, according to Jessica.

‚ÄúWith the success we had in the raises, on the outside they [seemingly] came easily,‚Äù Jessica says. ‚ÄúBut on the inside, getting to that place where you have momentum is hard.‚Äù

As they grew Lovevery, they found fundraising successfully was all about the timing. On an episode of How I Raised It, Jessica and Rod shared the lessons that came from raising $32 million for Lovevery over three funding rounds.
