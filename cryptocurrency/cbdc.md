However, the last few months this has changed as they have started to examine the new technologies like DLT or blockchain.

To evaluate a potential central bank digital currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System published a document in January 2022 titled¬†Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation.
