When listening to regulators, it becomes apparent that there's still a wide gap in understanding decentralized technologies, including blockchains. First off, blockchain technology (BT) is not the same as blockchain. The former refers to an advanced encryption scheme, and is mentioned as such in reference two of the Bitcoin Whitepaper. Bitcoin and other blockchains utilize this hashing and time-stamping schema in their architecture towards the three main innovations: smart contracts, digital bearer instruments, and decentralized autonomous organization structures. Well, it's technically just one, since the latter two are made-off the first.

As we know, cryptocurrencies exist in the digital world, yet they’re still currencies. For this reason, cryptocurrencies are divided into smaller units in the same way physical currencies are. Just as the pound’s little bro is pence and the dollar’s is cent, the smallest unit of Bitcoin is called Satoshi.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ka1g326i.jpg)
Today we wanna show you our view of  BTC/USD and situation on the market. 
We move inside the  falling wedge , we just reached the price of $7280 and it is a good support and at this point several indicators intersect: 
1. 61.8% fibonacci level;
2.  Falling wedge support line;
3. Diagonal support line formed by 4 points.

I think we will continue to move inside this  wedge and even a possible false break up this  wedge .
Soon we will talk about the New Year rally, which is likely to be in the black triangle in the range $6800-8400.
Now you can observe the intersection of the two main MA 200 and 50 - and this is called death cross - a signal for falling.

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving a strusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough formost   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model.Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannotavoid   mediating   disputes.     The   cost   of   mediation   increases   transaction   costs,   limiting   theminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and   there   is   a   broader   cost   in   the   loss   of   ability   to   make   non-reversible   payments   for   non-reversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants mustbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.
