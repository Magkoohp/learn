China is planning to unroll a series of blockchain-friendly laws in early 2020 to open themselves up to blockchain use cases. In a recent statement by President Xi Jinping, the country will aim to unroll its own digital coin. China has shown support in the past for projects like NEO, and more recently, TRON. At the same time, the country is very wary about token sales and any project that may cause losses on the personal finance level. China has taken a stance of “blockchain” versus speculative digital coins, and they aim to harness the power of distributed networks to distribute and secure data for various use cases.

Sometimes the EOS platform is advertised as an ecosystem that doesn't require any fees for making transactions. Technically, it is true. However, if you try to make an EOS transaction you will eventually find out that you need to put some of your EOS coins on hold.

For the last few months, there’s been a new hot topic in crypto circles: DApps!  Even as someone with a beginner’s understanding of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and its related environments, I hadn’t heard of the term ‘DApp’ until quite recently. But ever since, I’ve been deeply intrigued by them and their potential to change the way we perceive and interact with apps.

In May 2019, Equilibrium announced a partnership with Provable, a very efficient oracle that produces reliable real-time prices that the framework uses today to calculate critical levels every six minutes. Since this time, the project has also engaged in further research and development to reduce third-party risk, and improve the quality of its price feeds for EOSDT position owners and NUT (the framework’s utility token) holders.

Smart contract platforms are often considered to offer better long-term investment potential than pure cryptocurrencies. Despite Bitcoin now being more than ten years old, cryptocurrencies continue to face criticism for their speculative nature. On the other hand, a development platform can derive long-term value from the various projects built on it.

Before you think about deploying your EOS decentralized application (DApp) to a blockchain network, as a developer and system planner you should study in detail the cost to run your infrastructure on a public shared network with a limited amount of resources to be consumed. The storage cost and execution cost on a public blockchain network are higher than in any cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure.

What is the most irritating thing about EOS wallets? If you’re like me, it’s the
“welcome-aboard” payments you only find out about when you are being forced to pay them. There is nothing as disappointing as creating an EOS wallet and then having to pay just to conduct your first financial transaction. EOS newbies don’t know the ins and outs of how this system works, which might result in losing a certain amount of money that could be spent on crypto instead.

Every blockchain must be decentralized; that's the formula we've been hearing for years now. The prophets of decentralization, such as Vitalik Buterin, tell us that it's the most effective way to do almost anything. But let's think for a minute. Instead of having unknown people motivated only by small incentives, isn’t it better to have some reliable entities that care about their reputation?

Since EOS uses a different account structure than most blockchains, creating an account is not as simple as generating a single key pair. EOS accounts have various permissions which are linked to different actions in the account. While this might sound very complicated it is relatively simple to create an EOS account. We will discuss some of the possible methods in this article.

Accounts that require two or more keys to sign a transaction (requiring a certain permission), commonly referred to as multisignature accounts, are generally used to store funds securely and are without a doubt a very exciting EOS feature. But how do multisignature accounts work, how do you sign transactions with different keys and how can you set up a multisignature account yourself? We will explain all aspects of multisignature accounts on EOS in this article.
