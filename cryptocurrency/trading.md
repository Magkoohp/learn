Technical analysis (TA) represents one of the most popular mechanisms used by traders in capital markets and crypto is not the exception. One great thing about TA is that you can find as many fans as detractors in any asset class. In the case of a nascent and immature capital market such as crypto-assets, TA has established itself as one of the few viable mechanisms for extracting short term signals from the behavior of crypto assets. I’ve never been a fan of TA but I also don’t neglect its value and passionate community. Lately, we have been spending some time at IntoTheBlock, thinking about how some popular TA indicators can be improved with blockchain-native signals.

The current world is a very interconnected place. Countries trade with other countries, selling them the surplus of goods they produce and buying goods they don’t have in sufficient quantities. International trade encourages countries to specialize in producing only those goods and services which they can produce with the most efficiency at the lowest cost. It also makes it harder for domestic monopolies to thrive, because they face competition from foreign companies. Almost all economists agree that international trading is beneficial for all participants. But still, some countries are restricted from trading for various reasons. In this article we’ll try to understand the restrictions that many countries face, and how they can overcome them, using blockchain solutions.
