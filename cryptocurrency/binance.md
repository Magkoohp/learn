As Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao states, it is a sign of stimulus money flowing from Wall Street into Bitcoin.

Similarly in trading, periods of high volatility are always’!’ followed by periods of less volatility and again by periods of high volatility. We have to always remember that trading is a game of probability, the more sure we can become about the move the more successful would be our chance at it. Bollinger Bands is one more tool I would recommend you to master and use in conjunction with the others.

2019 has been the year of IEOs. With less than 2 months to go before we march into 2020, I think it’s a safe claim to make now.
