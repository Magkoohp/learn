Even the most savvy of business owners can't help but be impacted by COVID19. Why? Because their customers are--and that inherently impacts them. Small businesses will bear the majority of the burden as they are the ones most likely to have less financial runway to remain hindered or closed for a month or more at a time. It's scary, it's overwhelming. Large and mid-sized corporations are huddling (in a social distanced capacity)

Marketing mix models (MMMs), are a time-tested method for measuring the impact of your marketing and developing more well-informed strategic plans. However, in order to continue to access useful planning insights, businesses must adjust their models to account for the impact COVID-19 has had. Most existing MMMs have been built without specific consideration for dealing with unexpected events, meaning they may not be able to accurately account for many of the changes businesses are going through. By updating your models now, you can better understand the pandemic’s impact and get useful insights for your strategic planning.

We, therefore, decided to ramp down the budget for this campaign and allocate budgets to better performing campaigns. Standard operating procedure till here.
