The Wright brothers flew the first plane in 1917. At the time, going on an airplane was not common. Being a passenger on a flight was expensive. The focus for airlines was luxury.

They work with businesses to generate revenue.

The Renaissance was one of the most culturally, artistically, and scientifically significant transformations in Western history. It was an age of experimentation and innovation as cataloged by da Vinici’s numerous sketches and notebooks. A hallmark of this period of creation that mirrors today is a culture of sharing, and we see that in both times, innovators benefited from spaces and mediums to explore, share, and build upon each other. It seems in these places that fantastic innovation occurs seemingly out of thin air, but it’s not magic – innovation is an iterative process filled with fits and starts, catalyzed by the ability to share and build upon each other’s work. It defined the Renaissance and it will define our age.

If I had a penny for every time someone told me, “It’s like ____ but on a blockchain”, I’d probably have somewhere between $5-$10. Notoriously, the cryptocurrency market is riddled with blindly optimistic projects that rarely make good on their promises. Projects often led by teams who put great time and effort into theorizing complex blockchain use cases, but very little into how their projects will actually be executed, and even less on whether there is a demand for the product at all.

Over the next decade artificial intelligence could add upwards of $13 trillion to the global economy, and by 2030 the majority of companies could be using some form of artificial intelligence.

Overall, artificial intelligence is expected to have a positive impact on the global economy, even if there is a temporary period of human displacement that follows its implementation.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/r72z3606.png)
One of the most effective ways for retail investors to make money in the stock market is to invest in index funds, which have been found to generally outperform mutual funds over time. To date, the lack of a comprehensive index fund for crypto assets akin to those based on the S&P 500 in legacy financial markets has held the crypto market back; however, before crypto can effectively offer such opportunities to everyday people, the market needs a trustworthy index to accurately represent the state of the market. Such a measure would enable retail investors to make more informed decisions and perhaps entice institutional investors, such as pension funds and endowments, to make the leap into crypto.

With the unemployment rate at its lowest in 50 years and nominal wage at its highest in a decade, the American economy is thriving. However, the cost of living is outpacing wage, preventing Americans from living a great lifestyle.

One global recession in a single generation drives major changes in the economy and business landscape. Imagine dealing with two. Millennials (born between 1981 to 1996) are more affected by the 2009 recession and COVID-19 pandemic since their financial footing is much worse than their predecessors. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) deems that the economic toll due to the lockdown is much worse than the Great Depression.

The great lock down has helped to slow the spread of Covid-19. But it also came at a great cost to the global economy. Unlike a recession, many nonessential businesses have been closed with no clear timetable to reopen. The initial jobless claims in the US have swelled to more than 26 million since mid-March. While we see some glimmers of hope, we are not out of the woods yet. Businesses are anxious to reopen but we are also concerned with the health risks associated with it. The dilemma is if we reopen too quickly, we might risk triggering a second wave of Coronavirus which could be even worse.

Very few people understand basic financial concepts. That’s probably because we are taught from a young age that we shouldn’t talk about money. Unfortunately when people don’t talk about money they don’t learn how to manage their money, and finances become something mystical unable to be controlled or understood. But when people take the time to learn about managing their personal finances things turn out better. What if you could apply a growth mindset to hacking your finances?

The global financial system is comprised of a framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Our current global financial systems are based on a series of historical events and innovations that brought us to where we are today. Historical markers such as the first minted coin, the use of paper money, the adoption of the US dollar as the international reserve currency, abandonment of the gold standard, and the ubiquity of mobile payments have all greatly influenced the way we exchange and store value on a micro and macro scale.
