I started this blog post on disaster communications initially in response to the wildfires in Australia and earthquakes in Puerto Rico (seems a lifetime ago doesn't it?).

2020 was worldwide shitshow. The pandemic displaced team members, placed stress on families, and redefined what and where the day to day even is. Work goes on. As a company, we managed to double revenue for the third year in a row and raise some strategic funding. I'm still learning how to make a quality internet company.  We wouldn't be where we're at without the technological progress and innovation from so many other people, projects and organizations. This year at Hacker Noon, we decided to make our yearly donation $10k, choosing established nonprofits that consistently give more value back to the internet, and less established open source projects that have the potential to. I'm publishing this list to:

Few, if any, of my classmates shared my fascination with the Mark I Computer that was on display in our university’s Science Center. It is hard to blame them. Towering at 8 feet and filled with rotary switches, crystal diodes, and tangled wires, the Mark I resembles a prop from a science fiction movie rather than a computer the U.S. Navy once used. In its prime in the 1940s, the Mark I was one of the most powerful supercomputers on Earth; today, the smartphone we carry in our pockets would put it to shame. Yet, neither the smartphone nor the operating system that powers it would be possible without the early mainframes like the Mark I or the computer science pioneers who operated them. Many of those pioneers were women.
