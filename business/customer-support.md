Over the years, I have been through a number of I.T. shops. Sometimes supporting users was a big part and other times it was not.  One thing which was consistent was the enormous amounts of non-tech work support could generate. Without some kind of mechanism for funneling work into the I.T. department, it can become quite chaotic. Additionally, there can be undue stress for staff prioritizing things. Often circumstances force staff to use an arbitrary weighting of the severity of the issue, the title of the person reporting it and the history of ID-ten-T errors generated from the source.  This is obviously a less than ideal way to prioritize work.
