Och good old days..., when everyone was using computers with their square monitors, you could slap some site in minutes, upload on cheap hosting and everyone is coming right away and enjoying it and saying good words about it and the world is a happy place..., but not today!

Today to have a website even for fun, maybe a blog about your dog, you need to take care of many more things, and your site responsiveness is definitely one of them, what is responsiveness you asking? Ok, let's find out it first

Responsiveness is when your site changes the design based on the user's screen he/she uses if the visitor is coming to your site using a personal computer - your site looks one way if smartphone - another way.

It doesn't mean that you need to create a totally different design for all the screen sizes in the world, but changing how site elements positioned and shows up for different screens is a good start.

Why it's important?

Well A - if you want to miss out on something like 60% worldwide in 2020 of internet users and B - because you and your grandpa are on personal computers with big ass screens and C - only you two reading that blog, then maybe it's not that important.

But if you want others to come to your site and enjoy it then - it's one of the most important things you need to care about when building a website.

And I'm not even touching the business side of it, if you want to make money with your site then responsive design is crucial to have it.

People now days have such a short span for waiting and clicking and searching that if you make them think of what/where/why then that's it, withing few first seconds you just lost a customer.

Even Google lost its temper on this, now if your site is not responsive and slow, you'll have a hard time ranking your site to the top Google search positions.

Enough rambling!

The first time I came across bootstrap was when I was working on the front-end libraries curriculum on freeCodeCamp. I learned that it was a powerful framework that can be used to easily build responsive website designs. I didn’t understand how bootstrap worked under the hood, all I knew then was that when you do something like add a class of "img-responsive" to an image, it resizes itself when the screen size changes. Or that when you add a class of “btn btn-default” to a button element, it automatically styles the button and gives it color.
