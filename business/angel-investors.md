When friends Jessica Rolph and Rod Morris partnered to launch Lovevery in 2015, the two founders already had massive success stories under their belts. 

Jessica previously had a successful exit from organic baby food company Happy Family, which she founded. Rod helped take SaaS utility platform Opower public as part of the company’s leadership team.

Despite their wealth of past experience, Jessica and Rod had plenty to learn when fundraising for Lovevery, a subscription business that puts sustainable, science-backed play kits into the hands of parents. As parents themselves, Jessica and Rod knew their idea had legs when they began working on it — but they still felt “very vulnerable” during the fundraising process, according to Jessica.

“With the success we had in the raises, on the outside they [seemingly] came easily,” Jessica says. “But on the inside, getting to that place where you have momentum is hard.”

As they grew Lovevery, they found fundraising successfully was all about the timing. On an episode of How I Raised It, Jessica and Rod shared the lessons that came from raising $32 million for Lovevery over three funding rounds.

You arrive at a fork in the road. Rain pours down, with no end in sight. You are running out of resources, namely money, from which most resources are derived, including food and basic shelter. You are unable to make money out of the surrounding forest. Everything is very wet, you don’t have a saw, or a printer, or green ink. You have just listed three things you think go into the formation of paper currency, but you are generally unsure. You have now wasted an additional sixty seconds, for which you will never get back. Your inventory consists of:1. A business idea that you think is pretty good.2. A mobile app for your business that mostly works3. A pitch deck that you believe represents your true mission (but also says “fuck” on the first slide)4. A pitch deck that is for a similar but different business. (A positioning more enticing to investors.)5. Enough money to last you approximately two to three months 6.

The clerk feels bad for you and is willing to give you $5 USD. You accept.Now what?> Extract ink from counter.
