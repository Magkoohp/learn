Cybersecurity is among the most significant trends over the last decade and has become even more important now, especially due to more remote work being done. From ransomware to cyber espionage, hackers have developed sophisticated techniques to break into your project/company data and get away with critical information or demand ransom.

Even well known organizations such as Canon, Garmin, Twitter, Honda, and Travelex have fallen victims to malicious actors. A data breach can be a disaster for your company/project, destroy the trust of your customers, and spoil your company’s reputation.

We live our lives online these days – and given this simple fact, it should come as no surprise that cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing industries around, and one that’s critical to all other sectors. For those in the cryptocurrency industry, however, cybersecurity plays a more interesting role. That’s because, while cryptocurrency operations clearly need to enhance their own cybersecurity efforts, they’re also reliant on technology – blockchain – that other industries are using for their own security needs.
