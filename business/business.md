The 80/20 rule, a.k.a. Pareto principle, has been perpetuated along the lines: "80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes." Different cases where the rule emerges have been studied, in the last century, by great personalities such as Vilfredo Pareto (land ownership in Italy), George Kingsley Zipf (word frequency in Languages), and Joseph M. Juran (quality management in industries). Working as a Data Scientist, I have seen enough of the 80/20 rule being invoked in business meetings followed by a round of applause üëèüëèüëè. Also, I have read numerous LinkedIn posts alike. Most times, it is just a reckless stretch of the rule. But what is the danger here, if any? After all, profits matter more than mathematical and statistical rigor.

According to a McKinsey study of over 400 large enterprises across 12 industries, companies with high-performance engineering teams best their competition in all areas, including revenue growth, customer satisfaction, and brand perception. The evidence is so clear that the study itself is called, ‚ÄúHow software excellence fuels business performance,‚Äù and it concludes that software development is integral to business success in all industries ‚Äî retail, financial services, manufacturing, and of course, software companies, all require a strong engineering department to succeed. 

Yet, many executives view their engineering departments as a ‚Äúblack box.‚Äù While other departments report on their success with metrics like revenue, customer retention rate, or cost of new customer acquisition, engineering metrics don‚Äôt often make it into the board deck. But engineering metrics are essential to understanding how your company is doing. They convey critical information about your company‚Äôs ability to deliver value to your customers, and your company‚Äôs potential for future success. 

Plus, engineering is expensive ‚Äî it‚Äôs important to know whether that‚Äôs money well-spent. 

For a holistic picture of how your engineering department ‚Äî and your business ‚Äî is doing, you need to start tracking engineering metrics.
