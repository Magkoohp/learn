There is a lot to take away from the price performance of the digital asset market in 2020. One of such is that the concept of bitcoin halving, as expected, is a major contributing factor to the success of the bitcoin market and has eventually delivered the level of price swings projected during the pre-halving days. Another is that DeFi is perhaps the most potent application of cryptocurrency technology, which makes it the most plausible instigator of the next wave of growth. In the months following the global market crash, the DeFi landscape has attracted around $14 billion worth of capital. Why is this so?

A study by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance recently revealed that there are over 100 million crypto participants worldwide. This revelation is indicative of the crypto market’s growing attractiveness to investors interested in taking advantage of the inflation hedging capacity of Bitcoin and the profitability of DeFi tokens. The digital asset market has established itself as one of the best performing asset classes in 2020. And for this reason, I expect more investors to flock into the space.

During the chaos caused by the global pandemic, P2P, or peer-to-peer, transformed into a growing worldwide movement can no longer be left in shadow. Some experts even regard it as a way to save the global economy from an all-embracive post-pandemic crash. P2P already proved to be advantageous against a traditional exchange model in a number of ways – not least because it allows higher inclusion and can freely function even in countries that do not define cryptocurrency under their jurisdictions. Take an example of India – it is about to embark on the biggest bull rally of all time, and P2P exchanges are the engine behind it. Besides, P2P may be a lifeline for SMEs hit by the economic crash most severely – in conditions where they do not qualify for the bank credit support, P2P may become the only way to bail out.

There are several narratives identified as the propelling factors for the increasing demand for crypto assets. However, the most potent is the “store of value” narrative that has established crypto, most especially bitcoin, as the go-to-asset for investors looking to hedge against inflation. This sentiment trails what experts term as a critical period in human history borne by an unrelenting health crisis and a myriad of flawed economic policies designed to suppress its impact. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, over 17 million Americans will permanently lose their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The crypto market has evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s whitepaper was conceived 12 years ago, shortly after the U.S Financial Crisis which devastated the global economy. Today, this space enjoys a cool $400 billion in market capitalization with Bitcoin taking the lion share at a 62.4% dominance. Unlike like in the past where Bitcoin was the main narrative, dynamics are now shifting as crypto innovators pivot towards decentralized products and ecosystems.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/tN92BQhoO9hSIj7qCbWP5Te80pF3-q42031n1.jpeg)
Supply chain finance is one of the concepts countering conflicting interests arising from buyers’ traits of extending their payment terms and suppliers’ desire to receive payment instantly. This model mitigates the risks involved in the financing of the increasingly digitized global supply chains by enabling adequate working capital and providing the appropriate liquidity. As such, a supplier, with approved invoices, can receive the full amount owed by sourcing for funds from financial institutions. In turn, the financiers can provide extensions on the payables depending on the credit-worthiness of the buyer in question.

The current push for DeFi has not only changed the way we engage with our everyday financial needs but has also introduced new means of accessing, supporting, and investing in new projects. Tagged as Initial DEX Offerings (IDO), the possibility of bypassing restrictions when identifying and investing in projects has improved crypto funding. However, this does not mean that other models of crowdfunding have become redundant. For what is worth, Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) is still the go-to option for projects that prefer to capitalize on established launchpads and introduce a more diverse array of crypto products not necessarily restricted to the financial sector.
