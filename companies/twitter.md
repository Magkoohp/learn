Given that statement, any tool or mechanism that could help us mine and analyze data becomes a powerful resource to get your hands on. Data by itself has the potential to understand the universal behavior of people and assist businesses to design better use-cases. One such rich vein of data-source is Twitter and the data we can get from it concerning any particular topic is fascinating. Not to forget, one more thing which we would be exploring in this article is that we would be fetching data in real-time. Yes, you heard me right. We would be doing so in real-time.

As you know (I hope), the murder of George Floyd has caused protests and violent riots in Minneapolis, and many other cities around the United States. Yet again, another Black man was murdered by those hired to protects us. Four policemen pinned George to the ground after being called by a store clerk about disorderly conduct. An officer, by the name of Derek Chauvin, kneeled into George’s neck with extreme pressure, digging it into the ground to the point that he struggled to breath. As George was suffocating, he stated that he could not breath multiple times, but Chauvin did not let up. The other officers just stood by allowing it to happen, which makes them just as guilty. George died later that day. It took days just for Chauvin to even be arrested. He’s now been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. If you’re unaware of the story, please head here.

Twitter seems like a good product. Even up until the time of this article, I am still using it. However, some questions arise in regards to how Twitter is functioning and even its origin story.

Not long ago, we didn’t think too much about those terms of service (TOS) agreements and big tech. As big tech gets more negative press because of privacy concerns, it pays for all of us to double-check what we want to share and what we don’t. Many people are concerned enough that they are deleting their Facebook or Twitter accounts completely.

Social media marketing: this term has certainly become one of the most important for everyone who wishes to have a digital presence. Especially when you are a blogger, influencer, artist, coach, a new startup, or a solo entrepreneur - social media is the place when you can get the maximum attention from your target audience. But, for that, you need to be active on all your social media platforms. You need to post consistently and interact with your followers. This can be a little overwhelming as there are a lot of social platforms to manage at the same time. However, this task can be made easy by using a social media scheduler!

Depending on whom you ask, Elon is either an egotistical villain or a savior. He is currently the world’s richest man, with a net worth of about 200 Billion. Well, with that ind of money it becomes easy to create products that have a direct impact on people’s daily lives- with huge repercussions. Now, Elon is not your average billionaire. Most of the time, he has swayed the masses to his favor, much to the chagrin of big tech. This has turned him onto somewhat of a cult, with a huge following and an enviable portfolio of companies that seek to upend conventional beliefs and corporations. From Neuralink to Space X , Tesla to the Boring Company, he is an entrepreneur who seeks to “disrupt” global order as he strives to achieve what may somewhat be thought to be impossible, until its done.

Since late October, Facebook has come under scrutiny for changing its policies surrounding political ads. Previously, to run a political ad on Facebook, the ad had to be factually correct. Facebook would review political ads before they went live, and on an ongoing basis once they’re put live, removing any that it found to contain misinformation.

You are probably already aware who Jim Gaffigan is. If not, close your eyes and say "hot pocket" to yourself. If it comes out in that little sing-song voice, then you know Jim's work.

Jim's made a 30-year career of talking about pants, snacks, and family and become one of the broadest appeal and best paid comics in the world. Jim doesn't swear and doesn't talk about controversial topics -- he is in every way as accessible as he is likable. He certainly doesn't talk about politics.

That changed when Donald Trump accepted the GOP nomination.

Jim launched into a tirade addressing his 3.2 million followers on Twitter:

For the past 3 months, I've done a few development explorations with Twitter API. The results were (shameless plugs) my two projects, Tweet Scheduler and thank u, next. My experience has been less than stellar, to say the least. In my experience, the problem is that Twitter Developer documentation left a lot to desire. The biggest issue is Account Activity API, the new webhook concept that is quite challenging to understand and work with. In this post, I hope to explain how it works and build a fun Twitter bot to put these concepts in practice.
