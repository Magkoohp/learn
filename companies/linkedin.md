I have always been fascinated with the theatre and aspired to "learn" theatre (still do). Between 2017 - 2019, I was part of a Playback Theatre group in Bangalore called The Actors Collective. I was involved passively for a few months and some months very very passionately. As I revisited some of those experiences, it shed light on a few core principles that intersect nicely with the Startup mindset. The "Startup mindset" is something I think helps startup employees and founders, as well as folks who are starting a new role or dimension in their career. I'll go even as far as to say it is one of the most potent traits shared by a band of people that operate well together.
