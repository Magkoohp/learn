MRI has never been an easy option for a lot of people in the past who have suffered for this test in their life. There would be a considerable amount of unsettling experience that a patient has to bear throughout the MRI time. The Claustrophobia-inducing tube has to be placed over your body, and you have to be at a still position for more than one hour. It’s easy to think about in words, but the experience tends to become harder. Simultaneously, medical hardware creaks, whirs, and thumps around your body, which is not a good feeling.

However, thanks to the Facebook AI and NYU experts who have realized these issues and came up with the suggestion of artificial intelligence. It will help the entire system complete tests at a four-times faster speed. It will help all the patients to experience the process for a more decrease time and go. Hence, the entire process will get quicker as compared to the older times.

The best part about this model is that it will pair with high and low-resolution MRI scans. Another good thing about the procedure is that it will use the same model to predict the finals MRI scans results just after putting the input data for a quarter. In this way, there is a considerable chance that the data will come efficiently and faster than ever before. It will help the patients stop feeling the hassles they have to experience in the past so that the diagnoses will arrive more quickly.

According to Nafissa Yakubova (the AI researcher at FAIR working on this project, this decision is making a revolution in the MRI field.

The neural network makes it possible for the medial scan to construct an abstract idea. Later, the training data would be examined. Afterward, the same data will make it possible for the machine to predict the final output.

If we explain this idea with an example, consider an architect who tends to design infrastructure for numerous banks in a year or two. Later, the architect will get fully-aware of how a bank will look like. So, when a new project comes, the architect will finish the work quickly by creating the final blueprint.

If we talk about the FastMRI team, they have been working on this issue for a long time. However, the endless efforts made it easier for them to say that they have come up with a reliable method. The radiologists tried both AI and traditional ways of scans. 

At the same time, the experts are also worried about the errors that are evident in the process. So, they are considering experiments as an essential part of this process. There are various instances where humans have to manually check the output and make all the things evident to match the input correctly. Moreover, it’s worrying that the MRI scans could also may product incorrect outputs due to false predictions by the algorithm.

You might not have remembered their birthday, but they will definitely remember that you didn’t remember to remember it - and bye, bye, bestie. But don’t panic -  here lies the solution to your woes, and it's also pretty easy.

Something changed on the 18th of June 2019. The day that Libra went public. Facebook’s long rumoured cryptocurrency project, which has rallied 28 world-leading partners, came out of the closet, and with it this new asset class seems to have landed its first concrete, large scale application. With over 2.7 billion users spread across all of its platforms1(Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram), and in response to recent strides into the payment sector and digital wallets by the likes of Samsung, Apple and Tencent, it was time for the group led by Mark Zuckerberg to finally wade into the great cryptocurrency arms race unfolding before us.

The world has been evolving ever since its inception. There is no doubt that Generation-Z (1997-2012) has witnessed many changes. These changes were related especially with the advancement of science and technology. The concept of video calling dates back to the year 1910, and back then it was termed as video telephony. So, the concept is pretty antiquated, but with time innovation played its part and kept it looking contemporary. Having said that, we’ll now look at the options we have when it comes to video calling.

Of course, Libra is not a paper tiger. Otherwise it won’t cause theimmediate concern of global financial regulatory bodies and central banks, as well as the hearings by United States congress. But, this project indeed has inherent risks which make it very vulnerable. There is a good chance that it may get seriously delayed or may be forced to shut down if it cannot deal with these risks appropriately. If, unfortunately, it is forced to stop, then its short period of existence is then really a paper tiger.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/jbpo3872.jpg)
Facebook recently announced their new Libra cryptocurrency, a stablecoin set to launch in 2020 which will initially let users transfer money between Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp applications. However, the larger goal of Libra is to transform the global economy. In conjunction with other companies and partners that make up the Libra Association, including payments companies, technology companies, marketplaces, and venture capitalist firms, Libra has the potential to do just that. Having been involved in the cryptocurrency industry for the last couple of years there is definitely a reason to doubt how decentralized Libra truly is and if it can even be considered a cryptocurrency. However, one thing is certain, given the proposed makeup of Libra it could ultimately replace all current stablecoins, and quickly.

When Facebook first introduced the concept of Libra, their first digital currency, it looked promising. They designed the currency to become global and utilized a digital ledger, or blockchain technology,  just like any other cryptocurrency. Interestingly, unlike other cryptocurrencies, Libra would be backed by a ‘basket of currencies’, which would protect it from volatilities; the usual fluctuations that we see in a typical cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin.

Just over a week, most of you would have heard that Facebooks AI research team (FAIR) developed a neural transcompiler, that converts code from high level programming language like C++, Python, Java, Cobol into another language using ‘unsupervised translation’ . The traditional approach had been to tokenize the source language and convert it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which the transcompiler would use to translate to the target language of choice, based on handwritten rules that define the translations, such that abstract or the context is not lost.

### [290. How to Build a Stablecoin To Compete with Libra](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-stablecoin-to-compete-with-libra-wi2k3z30)

In my Libra project analysis report ( A Business Analysis of the Libra Project), I pointed out that there is still a very good opportunity to develop a new stablecoin that competes with Libra. The Libra project is definitely not the end of the stablecoin project, but a milestone in this process. More stablecoin projects will appear to provide more stablecoin products for the market. In terms of the mechanism for generating stablecoins, other stablecoin products can be substantially different from Libra. In terms of application scenarios of stablecoin, a more suitable application scenario can also be adopted. In view of the fact that stablecoin is still at a very early stage and all the risks of the Libra project, other stablecoin products still have a very high probability of success. As long as the correct strategy is adopted in the design of stablecoin, promotion organization and adoption scenario, it is very likely that the new stablecoin can be better accepted by the market. This article discusses some of the factors related to the new stablecoin.

On October 6th 2020, the House lawmakers released a 449-page report investigating how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google managed to turn from “scrappy” start-ups into “the kinds of monopolies we saw last in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons”.
