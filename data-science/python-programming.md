It is a reference implementation of the interpreter under the guidance of Guido van Rossum. Version 3.10 is current as of November 14, 2021. By now, Python means only version 3, but before this version appeared, mentions of version 2 can still be found. Now version 2 is not supported and most companies are removing the remnants of the code from version 2. by porting the code to version 3. As of January 1, 2020, Python 2 is no longer supported [https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/]. And this is quite understandable since, after the release of Python 3 in 2006, developers had to support 2 versions at the same time, which is laborious.
