Simple linear regression is useful for finding the relationship between two continuous variables. One is a predictor or independent variable and the other is a response or dependent variable. It looks for a statistical relationship but not a deterministic relationship. Relationship between two variables is said to be deterministic if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other. For example, using temperature in degrees Celsius it is possible to accurately predict Fahrenheit.
