I'm definitely a fan of cats üò∫Ô∏è in real life, but when it comes to 
code this reverses and I've got a preference for Pug üê∂Ô∏è For those who 
aren't coders: PugJS is a JavaScript template engine. It converts 
Pug-lang into HTML. I know there is more power in PugJS, besides the 
simple turning the Pug-lang into HTML. At the moment I'm not using the 
potential of the language - I use PugJS mostly to hold my content. Let's
 look at some ways to get more out of Pug I've learned about recently.

![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/BopVyRYKQYeTCO7MGch2)
The degree of employer‚Äôs brand relevance is reflected in the latest statistics: according to Employer Branding Insights Report 2019, 90% of candidates consider HR brand of an employer when applying, 95% of respondents say company‚Äôs reputation matters a lot for them. As per Talentnow, 50% of candidates would never work for a company with bad reputation even if they are offered more in terms of salary. The dominant majority of HR specialists agree that recruitment increasingly acquires features of marketing: the ability to sell a company as an outstanding employer has a direct impact on talent acquisition.

People is the most valuable asset of any business. Our clients are pursuing the goal of building an HR- / employer‚Äôs brand. We are witnessing the steady growth of market demand. Companies are willing to invest in people and their employer‚Äôs brand. In view of this, I offer to discuss the topic from PR perspective.
