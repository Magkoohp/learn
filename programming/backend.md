![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/be19l33vn.jpg)
Typically, when we build a single-page application, the frontend and the backend are living in two very separate worlds that are connected with a web API. Even if they are implemented with the same language (JavaScript), they cannot communicate directly using this language. They need something else in between, so we build a web API (REST, GraphQL, etc.), and that complicates everything.

### [42. Functional Programming In Ruby: How To Create Pure Functions](https://hackernoon.com/functional-programming-in-ruby-how-to-create-pure-functions-0uq3ujr)

In functional programming, pure functions are at the core of this paradigm. When we speak of pure functions we mean that these functions satisfy two main conditions; the first is that they will not cause any side effects and the second is that depending on their arguments they will return the same result. When you create pure functions you should try to make them take care of one thing and only one, so your functions will be very easy to test and scale. Consider the following function:

When I’m learning something new I like to talk to myself about it until I feel I understand it. You can feel when you’re just hiding behind the fact that no one else is questioning you, and you’re really just kind of lying to yourself. “Yeah yeah, REST, CRUD, awfully simple…”

ver open up a Rails console to debug a problem and come away wondering how the data got so funky? Despite our best efforts the database will accept plenty of garbage data if you let it. There are tons of methods to bypass the Rails callbacks and validations while still updating your database. If you are like me you have probably used these methods in the Rails console to fix some of that funky data you found after some other code created it in the first place.

As learning Mongo was the main intention, I’ve decided just to make the core app which is the backend functionality and no front end as it’s not necessary and I hate to do it.

Spring MVC is a framework that is used to build web applications. It follows the Model View Controller pattern. DispatcherServlet is the servlet that controls the flow of a request from view to controller. Since Spring 3.1, the Servlet 3 API is supported and we no longer need web.xml for configuring DispatcherServlet – instead, it is configured programmatically.

RESTful APIs are everywhere, powering more of the modern world than any other API architecture. REST accounts for up to 80% of APIs according to this study by ProgrammableWeb. How those APIs are built and structured can make or break a company in today’s ultra-competitive world. Poorly-designed APIs can be difficult to use, can fail when they are needed most, and are valuable targets for hackers looking for sensitive data. On the other hand, a well-designed API that utilizes best practices makes development a breeze, attracts new customers, and creates confidence among users that can boost retention rates.

I’ve spent the last 10 years of my life as a System Engineer, which means when I first had to build an API, I had no idea how to do it. I knew python quite a bit since as a SysAdmin I often had to write some smaller or bigger scripts, but building the whole API was a challenge for me. Sure — I could just google the phrase and find dozens of tutorials on how to build an API, but all of them were somehow complicated or created for raw developers (which means — with assumptions that you know already all the tools and frameworks that developers use).

Front-end seems to be one of the most popular developers’ niche over the last years. Front-enders create the front view of the web application. The code consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code. This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and impersonate users. According to the Open Web Application Security Project, XSS was the seventh most common Web app vulnerability in 2017.

Here, we have four roles: Sme, Sponsor, Admin, Operations.Initially, we had only 3 roles.Operations role was added later and Operations user has permissions similar to the Admin user.In the code, we had to replace every instance of if (user.type == USER_TYPES.ADMIN) with if (user.type == USER_TYPES.ADMIN || user.type == USER_TYPES.OPERATIONS).As this is time consuming and we can also miss many instances, we have created a roles module. In the roles module,the roles are defined along with their respective permissions as seen in Code (Part-III). Based on the permissions for each role, we will evaluate the authorization for the user in each of our controller methods.If the user has access, only then he will be granted the resources.

In cryptography, a ciphertext is a scrambled message that conveys information but is not legible unless decrypted with the right cipher and the right secret (usually a key), reproducing the original cleartext. A ciphertext's security, and therefore the secrecy of the contained information, depends on using a secure cipher and keeping the key secret.

As a student of Microverse, I’ve reached the point where Rails’ framework was introduced to me. It appeared to me with the best omens on its hands. Ruby on Rails is a starting point for many start-ups because all of them got blinded by its beauty and simplicity. I have to admit that I felt intimidated for a while. Surely I can't say we are the best friends now but things started to make sense. Ruby on Rails is designed under the MVC principles - Model View Controllers.

Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a protocol used to secure datagram-based communications. It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security (TLS), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.
