![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/6iu63y8i.png)
The Rust programming language is an ambitious project of the Mozilla Foundation – a language that claims to be the next step in evolution of C and C++. Over the years of existence of these languages some of their basic flaws still haven’t been fixed, like segmentation errors, manual memory control, risks of memory leaks and unpredictable compiler behavior. Rust was created to solve these problems while improving security and performance along the way.

### [9. After 20 Years Of Web Development, I Am Ready For Disruption](https://hackernoon.com/after-20-years-of-web-development-i-am-ready-for-disruption-feh3tp1)
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FMJpFVUEItkSdoh38rYo60VT7RfH3-741328jz.jpeg?alt=media&token=718b9965-5df7-4e98-b0f7-669796b2214d)
I have been working in web technology for more than 20 years. I spent the first five years of my career as a full-stack developer. Back then, we used the term webmaster. I would set up servers (which included e-mail and FTP), order domain names, create databases and order SSL certificates. I would code the backend and the frontend, plus open up Photoshop to do a little bit of design and UX from time to time. I was the scrum master and the business analyst plus I would support customers and project manage their websites. These tasks and job titles were all just part of being a webmaster. You crafted the web by yourself, and it lived in a box in the room next door, occasionally you would have to go in and check on it, maybe even restart it.

Later in my career, I saw an opportunity to specialise. Living and working in London, I saw the increasing need for the expert. Recruiters started to ring me, asking about specialist job titles. I very much enjoyed the visual element of working in the browser and JavaScript was growing in power and clearly here to stay.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/rii3yih.png)
Most programs on Linux are dynamically linked. So when you are creating a unikernel with OPS out of a linux application OPS goes out and finds all the libraries it's dynamically linked to and throws it onto the disk image. This works well if you are on linux - 99% of everything on linux is dynamically linked.
