![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/wz1tx33jc.png)
When we are developing an android application it is common to come across a situation where we want to show an image somewhere in the app.The easiest way to handle this is to bundle the image along with the app but the downside to it would be increasing the size of the app. It is not feasible if the application needs to display a lot of high resolution images.So, the next best thing is to host the image in some server and download it from there when the app starts. This is where image caching plays a very important role. We download the image once and store it in our cache and reuse it whenever required. This post will show how we can do that using just one annotation using the ColdStorage library.
