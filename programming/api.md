One of the main reasons for using Node.js is that you can create quickly RESTful web APIs with it. Express is a popular web framework helping you with this task. Using JavaScript to build servers is often a natural choice for frontend developers looking for a way to reuse their skills and create the APIs supporting their web app, but that's not the only benefit of using Node.js. The huge package ecosystem around Node.js and Express is what makes it shine, allowing to implement a lot of business features with very few lines of code.

Whether you're making API calls from Node.js or in the browser, connection failures are going to happen eventually. Some request errors are valid. Maybe the endpoint was wrong or the client sent the wrong data. Other times you can be sure that the error is the result of a problem with the connection to the server or one of the many hops in-between. While API and web service monitoring can inform you about the problem, a more active solution can take care of it for you.

APIs have been around for decades ‚Äì they allow different systems to talk to each other in a seamless, fast fashion ‚Äì¬† yet it‚Äôs been during the past decade that this technology has become a significant force.

So then why all the interest in APIs? We all know the usual stories ‚Äì Uber, Airbnb, Apple Pay‚Ä¶¬† the list goes on, and the reasons are plentiful.¬† Today the question is, how?¬† Perhaps you are looking to differentiate your business or want a first-mover advantage.¬†¬†How can you execute quickly and at low cost/risk to try new market offerings?

An API provides several benefits to an organisation, but without a dedicated team of trained developers, it might seem like an implausible option. Developers are expensive, and it can take months to¬†develop an API¬†from the ground up. If you don‚Äôt fancy outsourcing or have the capability in house to¬†build internal APIs, a low-code platform might just be the answer.

I‚Äôve spent the last 10 years of my life as a System Engineer, which means when I first had to build an API, I had no idea how to do it. I knew python quite a bit since as a SysAdmin I often had to write some smaller or bigger scripts, but building the whole API was a challenge for me. Sure ‚Äî I could just google the phrase and find dozens of tutorials on how to build an API, but all of them were somehow complicated or created for raw developers (which means ‚Äî with assumptions that you know already all the tools and frameworks that developers use).

While working on a recent project, I realized that heavy processes for python like scrapping could be made easier though python's multiprocessing library. The documentation and community engaging in multiprocessing is fairly sparse, so I wanted to share some of my learnings through an example project of scrapping the Pok√©API. Below I wrote a bit of code that pulls all of the available pok√©mon while minding the API's 100 calls per 60 second limits. You'll see that the iteration is fairly slow as there are 964 pok√©mon the API returns.

The two main different approaches to a DCF valuation are in regards to what we can value. We can choose to value the equity of stock or the whole firm. In valuing equity or a Free Cash-Flow to Equity model (FCFE), we only value the equity - and with it compute the cost of equity when looking at the discount rate, but not the cost of debt.

I‚Äôve held several roles in my career in IT, ranging from software developer to enterprise architect to developer advocate. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the role that data plays in our applications‚Äîputting it into databases, getting it back out quickly, making sure it remains accurate when transferred between systems. Many of the hardest problems I‚Äôve encountered have centered around data. For example:

### [489. Getting Your API Into Production](https://hackernoon.com/getting-your-api-into-production)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hy5hwiViojexm8PPhxbom0FcgtT2-dh93og6.jpeg)

APIs are stable until they aren‚Äôt. We talk about that often at Bearer. If you control the APIs, it gets easier, but with third-party APIs and integrations, it can be more difficult to predict when an outage or incident is about to happen.

### [492. Book Rating System From Scratch using Goodreads API and Slash GraphQL](https://hackernoon.com/book-rating-system-from-scratch-using-goodreads-api-and-slash-graphql-xy1x31bx)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nTMgodFHH4evRjSdNFNz3dacaM23-mebg35d9.jpeg)
GraphQL is a relatively new way to build user interfaces and APIs for consumers. It's essentially a querying language backed by a strongly typed schema, which makes it easy to write human-readable requests to get exactly the data you need. Compared to REST, whose responses are dictated by the server, GraphQL queries place the power squarely in the hands of the client.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/jf1f3wii.gif)
How ubiquitous are APIs in today‚Äôs development processes? Try asking an engineer how many APIs their project integrates. Most teams won‚Äôt know the answer. From analytics tools to maps and cloud hosting, modern applications use a hefty collection of internal and public APIs. Developers use these to quickly assemble applications that would otherwise take much more effort to build. However, there‚Äôs a forgotten expense not typically calculated early in a project.

Modern applications aren‚Äôt built in silos. They rely on the features of other applications. This reliance can come in the form of open-source libraries, access to a wealth of data, or complex features distilled down into a consumable API. Incorporating third-party dependencies into your own project can be challenging. It comes with the benefits of faster development, and the downside of reliance.¬†

APIs can be as simple as 1 endpoint for use by 100s of users or as complex as the AWS APIs with 1000s of endpoints and 100s of thousands of users. Building them can mean spending a couple of hours using a low-code platform or months of work using a multitude of tools. Hosting them can be as simple as using one platform that does everything we need or as complex as setting up and managing ingress control, security, caching, failover, metrics, scaling etc.

API Analytics are key for any platform company that wants to gain insights into their API and platform usage. These insights can be leveraged by product owners, growth teams, developer relations, and more to make more strategic decisions based on the raw health of your platform business rather than just gut feelings. However, many API platforms have a very high volume of API calls per day. This volume creates a set of unique challenges when designing an analytics system that scales without crippling their platform or having sticker shock when looking at their cloud vendor‚Äôs bill. This post goes into some of the inner workings of how we designs Moesif‚Äôs API analytics platform to handle companies with billions of API calls a day.
