As a Microverse student for one month, I realized that my first clone webpages didn’t have a responsive layout. I was using pixels in the Navbars, percentages in one section and rem in another, I didn’t have a rule or a standard procedure. The goal was to make it look like the original webpage IN MY SCREEN.

As I advanced through the course, I learned that these units made all the
difference to the webpage’s response in different screen sizes. My code
reviewers would tell me to adjust my webpage because it looked different when they were viewing it.

When I started having these issues, I made a lot of research on the subject,
but I was still a little confused about it. This article’s goal is to create a
simple and direct rule to achieve the required responsiveness any developer needs in their code.
