It goes without saying that if you want to orchestrate containers at this point, Kubernetes is what you use to do it. Sure, there may be a few Docker Swarm holdouts still around, but for the most part, K8s has cemented itself as the industry standard for container orchestration solutions. As Kubernetes matures, the tools that embody its landscape begin to mature along with it. One of the areas we have seen some optimization, in particular, is in cloud-native storage solutions.

The DevOps practices are helping companies build software that will function properly in a more automated world & this is what building cloud-native software is all about. While the cloud-native approach is becoming more critical and making life easier for everyone involved in software development, there are still industries that are laggards and kind of scared to move out of their legacy practices. Yes, we are talking about the highly regulated industries like Healthcare, Financial corporations, government agencies, etc. When it comes to adopting new technologies of building software, these industries have always remained slow because of the limitations they carry with them. But recently we have seen so many traditional banks and hospitals moving towards DevOps and cloud-native practices.

A service mesh’s primary objective is to handle internal service to service communication, while an API Gateway handles external client to service communication. It is required to apply API Management for the microservices that are in a service mesh. Although they overlap in some cases, service mesh’s focus and API Management focus is different. For an example, API gateway handles north south traffic, while service mesh handles east west traffic.

In early 2020 the PlaceExchange SRE team was challenged to build support for the company's first gRPC application that would run on Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Our usage of third-party geocoding APIs was beginning to exceed the cost of implementing our own service, and so we decided to build one with a gRPC interface. We had already operated EKS for several months with RESTful services and felt confident in our ability to deliver a platform capable of hosting multiple instances of the API for our developers to work concurrently. Given our extensive use of per-developer environments (namespaces) and adherence to the infrastructure as code model, it seemed natural to extend this pattern to support gRPC services.

The vast majority of Kubernetes clusters are used to host containers that process incoming requests from microservices to full web applications. Having these incoming requests come into a central location, then get handed out via services in Kubernetes, is the most secure way to configure a cluster. That central incoming point is an ingress controller.

Cloud computing is becoming more and more of a household name, with even the most conservative fields of business figuring out how to make the best use of it. Cloud computing usually starts with running a private cloud solution on premises before venturing onto the public cloud. Of course, the cloud is not a single uniform being. It may come from different providers, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure being the biggest players here. Or it may come with different visibility and hosting, that is, public (resides with the provider), private (self-hosted), or hybrid (which uses a bit of both). And the cloud can use different tools and APIs for management as well.

Applications built on monolithic/ 3-tier/ n-tier architecture often fail to meet the market demands in terms of scaling and performance. This is generally attributed towards the inflexible nature of these architectures, where code base becomes unmanageable due to various reasons - like addition of new features, identifying dependencies, and side effects that could crop up due to scaling, etc. In these environments, adopting new technologies and making changes take a long time. The bottom line is that they are less agile and ancient.

Earlier, developers simply wrote their program, built it and ran it. Today, developers need to also think of the various ways of running it whether it be as a binary on a machine (virtual most likely), by packaging it into a container, by making that container a part of a bigger deployment (K8s) or by deploying it into a serverless environment or a service mesh. However, these deployment options are not part of the programming experience for a developer. The developer has to write code in a certain way to work well in a given execution environment, and removing this from the programming problem isn’t good.

Kubernetes needs no introduction in this cloud-native world. It was born when I was a middle-aged man. Years later, I am still as young as earlier (take with a pinch of salt) while Kubernetes grew out to be a fine tool that outperformed other platforms in enabling operational efficiency and application resilience.

Buildah is a tool for building OCI-compatible images through a lower-level coreutils interface. Similar to Podman, Buildah doesn't depend on a daemon such as Docker or CRI-O, and it doesn't require root privileges. Buildah provides a command-line tool that replicates all the commands found in a Dockerfile. This allows you to issue Buildah commands from a scripting language such as Bash.
