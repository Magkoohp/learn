# [redux](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/redux)
An open source javascript library, commonly used with libraries like React or Angular for building user interfaces. It is used for centralizing and managing application state.

Singletons are fairly controversial as far as I can tell, especially in Javascript programming. Let's take a look at what they are, when to (maybe) use them, and when not to.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/kzt30l1.jpg)
Immutable, structurally shared data structures are a great paradigm for storing state. Especially when combined with an event-sourcing architecture. However, there is a cost to pay. In a language like JavaScript where immutability is not built into the language, producing a new state from the previous one is a boring, boiler-platy task. To prove the point: The Redux-ecosystem-links page alone lists 67(!) packages to help you to deal with immutable data structures in Redux.

I’ve been working with react-redux, and I’m loving it, working with react is awesome, but it can get confusing really fast, so when I was introduced to redux I just instantly loved it. The thing is… when I created an application using yarn create ract-app --template redux, the app had a different syntax than the one I was taught in all the tutorials I saw on youtube, so I started playing around with the default application, and the way they do things there is cleaner and more straight forward. After a quick google search, I realized the default app uses the @redux/toolkit and I wanted to talk about it because it’s pretty great, so…

State management is challenging. We can make it less challenging by making sure we don’t store any redundant information in our state. What do I mean? Let’s say in our program we need to figure out whether people will be allowed in our bar. We can determine this by examining a couple attributes of the person: we can look at his or her age (anyone who is 21 or older may enter the bar) or we can look at whether he or she is an employee of the bar (all bar employees are allowed to enter, regardless of age). Now, we could store all this information in our state object:

Managing data-flows can be quite tricky in javascript. A pattern that really fascinated me over the last years is the flux architecture from facebook. Especially the redux implementation. But redux just tells you how to store your data and how to update the state. It’s really liberal in how to manage data-flows. So really awesome data-flow middleware libs where born like redux-saga and redux-observable.

Redux is awesome! But people often complain about how much boilerplate they have to write when working with it. Part of this problem, is because they feel unproductive defining constants, action creators and big reducers, but also because they don’t have a clear idea on how to organize their project, or even how to proper handle async requests. On this post, we are going to talk about those concerns and present some approaches to handle them.
