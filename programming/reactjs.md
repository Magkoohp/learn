A common approach to website development is to build components that can be reused across different web pages. The benefit to this approach is that you end up doing less duplicate work by managing the components rather than managing duplicate content across different pages. Popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue and Angular utilize this concept on the application code level to much success. How can we benefit from this approach on the content management level?

If your users have their system set up correctly a simple click will open their email account with your email in the mailto: slot(aka send). However as a developer this seems less than ideal because it requires  that your users have the proper set up to handle the action.
