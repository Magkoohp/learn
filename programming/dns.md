As we adjust to life during a pandemic, two things have become clear: First, the internet is essential; second,  the internet is full of dangers. Each of these dangers is different: They vary in the sort of attack they strike with, our familiarity with them, and the tools we can use to avert them. For example, viruses have been well-known for decades. Every PC is currently protected with antivirus software--and in many cases, it’s incorporated right into your operating system. Other types of internet threats, such as botnets, are newer, more difficult to detect, and less known to web users.

Communicating with each other, i.e., applications, devices, web pages, requires a standard naming system. The naming system allows every shred of technology to recognize each other as well as an essential part of knowing where to send the information. It is vital when devices need to communicate with resources over the internet due to the vast quantity of services and websites that need to be recognized. This is the reason why the Domain Name System (DNS) is crucial to the business organizations.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) provide an easy way for online anonymity.With just a few clicks, it makes it possible to mask your location and hide your online activity from prying eyes. VPNs aren’t however foolproof; a DNS leak could leave you exposed even when the VPN is ON. DNS (dynamic name system) links IP addresses with the URL a user has visited. The website sends a request to the DNS Server (containing the URL), which then points it to the appropriate IP address.
