Cloud computing has grown exponentially in the past decade and is not about to stop. As predicted by Forrester’s research, the global public cloud infrastructure will grow 35% in 2021, many thanks to the pandemic. Due to the lingering effects of covid-19 in 2021, the cloud will be the key focus for organizations looking for increased scalability, business continuity, and cost-efficiency.

DevOps have become a popular term in the software industry since 2009. The primary reasons behind this increasing popularity are the high-speed and less-cost of development. DevOps were born to meet the increased software industry velocity. In comparison to DevOps, traditional Ops are 41% more time-consuming.

Back-end engineering nowadays may require the integration of multiple services. It is painful for engineers to install many services in their local development environment. Docker has provided an easier way to do this, but it will still require some scripting outside our code. It also has not exactly had a perfect solution if we wanted to test smaller functions or classes instead of the whole service. This problem has been addressed by Testcontainers [1].

Enterprises around the world are waking up to the containers and Kubernetes trend. There are numerous benefits of delivering an application as container packages to Kubernetes but at the same time, the process of app containerization and the subsequent app deployment to Kubernetes can hit many roadblocks. Since the idea of using Kubernetes and containers for app delivery is fairly recent, the transition from traditional delivery systems to these modern delivery systems is a bumpy ride.

The lightweight Kubernetes OS that is known as k3OS has quickly been gaining popularity in the cloud-native community as a compact and edge-focused Linux distribution that cuts the fat away from the traditional K8s distro. While k3OS is picking up steam, it is still on the bleeding edge and there is still a bit of a shortage of learning material out there for it.

We use different Continuous Integration tools in our projects. One of them is TeamCity software. A pipeline for TeamCity can be configured easily and has two steps, such as run tests and build a docker image for further deployment. However, I needed to run Postgres before running tests. I made a research, I read the documentation and this article may be useful to close a gap for team city’s documentation.

Docker, along with Docker Compose are the most used tools under the DevOps category, according to  The State of Developer Ecosystem 2019 survey by JetBrains. Chances are if you're using Docker/Docker Compose for deployment, you'll most likely be using them for local development as well. If you only use Docker for deployment but a virtual environment for local development, you may want to look into using Docker for development to reduce the parity between dev/prod environments, as suggested in the Twelve-Factor Methodology.

As time progressed, programming methods became simpler so that applications can be developed and delivered fast. This led to the popularity of low-code and later no-code approach to application development. Both low-code and no-code take a drag-and-drop visual approach to build business applications more efficiently. The idea is to reduce or replace complicated coding with a configuration approach. This allows citizen developers to build and test applications quickly.

Kubernetes is the Greek word for helmsman or pilot. It is now accelerating the digital transformation at firms by helping them transition away from legacy technology and embrace cloud-native software development. The recent KubeCon event had a gathering of more than 12,000 developers and executives from around the world in San Diego. Every company wants to take advantage of Kubernetes and its ability to automatically deploy, manage, and scale software workloads in the cloud.

Software is eating the world, in all sectors. Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape, said it long back about how software is eating the world. He also summarised that every company is a software company these days, and software companies are poised to take over broad swathes of the economy. You’ll see DevOps clearly in 2020, where continuous updates transform the way software is delivered to a nearly-limitless marketplace. DevOps has become a must to thrive in this highly competitive technological world.

Ever since Docker went live in early 2013 it’s had a love-hate relationship with programmers and sysadmins. While some ‘experienced’ developers that I’ve talked to have a strong dislike for containerization in general (more on that later), there’s a reason why a lot of major companies including eBay, Twitter, Spotify and Lyft have reportedly adopted Docker in their production environments.

A service mesh’s primary objective is to handle internal service to service communication, while an API Gateway handles external client to service communication. It is required to apply API Management for the microservices that are in a service mesh. Although they overlap in some cases, service mesh’s focus and API Management focus is different. For an example, API gateway handles north south traffic, while service mesh handles east west traffic.

Buildah is a tool for building OCI-compatible images through a lower-level coreutils interface. Similar to Podman, Buildah doesn't depend on a daemon such as Docker or CRI-O, and it doesn't require root privileges. Buildah provides a command-line tool that replicates all the commands found in a Dockerfile. This allows you to issue Buildah commands from a scripting language such as Bash.

Most of the startups facing scaling problems move to microservices. Inspired by cell-based architecture, it split services per function and scale only specific features. It works especially well for B2C where traffic is uniformly spread across users. However, B2B can face a different type of scaling issue where only one user is scaling. A pool architecture is a simpler yet powerful solution, used both by GAFA and fast-growing startups.

Cloud computing is becoming more and more of a household name, with even the most conservative fields of business figuring out how to make the best use of it. Cloud computing usually starts with running a private cloud solution on premises before venturing onto the public cloud. Of course, the cloud is not a single uniform being. It may come from different providers, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure being the biggest players here. Or it may come with different visibility and hosting, that is, public (resides with the provider), private (self-hosted), or hybrid (which uses a bit of both). And the cloud can use different tools and APIs for management as well.

Applications built on monolithic/ 3-tier/ n-tier architecture often fail to meet the market demands in terms of scaling and performance. This is generally attributed towards the inflexible nature of these architectures, where code base becomes unmanageable due to various reasons - like addition of new features, identifying dependencies, and side effects that could crop up due to scaling, etc. In these environments, adopting new technologies and making changes take a long time. The bottom line is that they are less agile and ancient.

When using Docker to run applications security is a major concern, but it can sometimes be easy to forget as we focus first on functionality. This doesn't need to be the case, as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) can now be setup to automatically scan images on push, and provide feedback on any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

Ah yes—“It works fine on my machine!” Perhaps the most famous saying in our industry. Even with the advent of containers that provide consistent environments across the SDLC, we still hear developers fall back to this claim when a defect is found. But in the end, if the code doesn't work in test or production, it doesn't work—even if it works locally. So as a developer, being able to deep dive into your containerized application to fix the problem—regardless of the environment—is a critical skill we must all learn.

Podman is the command-line interface tool that lets you interact with Libpod, a library for running and managing OCI-based containers. It is important to note that Podman doesn't depend on a daemon, and it doesn't require root privileges.
