ES6 came with many new features, but one of the best features was the official introduction of Promises. Promises allow you to write clean non-callback-centric code without ever having to worry about callback hell. Even if you never write your own promise, knowing how they work is incredibly important, since many newer parts of the JavaScript API use promises instead of callbacks. The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation.

As React is just a lib, it doesn‚Äôt dictate rules about how you should organize and structure your projects. This is nice, because it gives us freedom to try different approaches and adapt the ones that better fit for us.

It's been a long time since Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) showed up to become the basis of the web. Since that time, many things have changed, and some features of the HTML files went from desirable to negative.

Explicit Interface Implementation is a complex and rarely used technique that allows a single class to inherit from multiple interfaces that have the same method signature.¬†Explicitly implementing each interface, prepending the interface name to the method, allows the same method signature to exist in the same class.¬†I shall not demonstrate that here, but there are plenty of examples of this online.¬†There is another benefit to explicitly implementing an interface, and that is to hide members from being accessed via the class reference.¬†I‚Äôll create an example of this technique using a factory design pattern and Fruit class and a console application that you can step through via F11.¬†If you create a new C# console application in Visual Studio, then copy and paste all of the below code, you can step through (F11) the code to see how it works.

Since its advent in 1991, Python has been the choice of coders due to its simple features that include ease of understanding and readability of code but not limited to just that. There have been lots of changes in the codebase over time due to the contribution from developers worldwide. Simple syntax and faster execution make Python a favorable language among programmers. It is used widely to create websites and primarily in big data operations. To make the task of running Python programs easier, many IDEs have been developed for programmers. These environments are equally suitable for beginners and advanced coders with a variety of in-built extensions, libraries, and plugins to ease the task of program execution. Let's walk you through these six IDEs that can ease your work with Python:
