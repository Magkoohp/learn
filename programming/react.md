As React is just a lib, it doesn’t dictate rules about how you should organize and structure your projects. This is nice, because it gives us freedom to try different approaches and adapt the ones that better fit for us. On the other hand, this could cause some confusion for devs that are starting in React world.

JavaScript popularity continues its rising. In 2016 we’ve witnessed such great changes, as AngularJS entire upgrade and introduction of Angular 2, ultimate dominating of jQuery that is applied on 96.5% of all JS sites, evolution of ECMAScript, two updates of Node.js in April and October accordingly, React finest hours, and even more. What to expect from 2017? — Here’s what we know so far: Angular 4 is expected in March 2017, ES2017 edition is planned for mid-2017, Bootstrap v4 release should be anticipated this year as well.

### [12. Conditional Rendering in React](https://hackernoon.com/conditional-rendering-on-react-57a864c2d04d)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/tir31l8.jpg)
When we are developing a React application, we often need to show or hide an element given a certain condition. Be it a user interaction, the presence of data coming from a request, or even permission levels. This is called conditional rendering, and we’ll look at different approaches to handling those cases.

### [13. Introducing Immer: Immutability the easy way](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-immer-immutability-the-easy-way-9d73d8f71cb3)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/kzt30l1.jpg)
Immutable, structurally shared data structures are a great paradigm for storing state. Especially when combined with an event-sourcing architecture. However, there is a cost to pay. In a language like JavaScript where immutability is not built into the language, producing a new state from the previous one is a boring, boiler-platy task. To prove the point: The Redux-ecosystem-links page alone lists 67(!) packages to help you to deal with immutable data structures in Redux.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*Pmm5N4hr9cANciDL5nbDpw.png)
When it comes to structuring a React app, the ideal structure is the one that allows you to move around your code with the least amount of effort.

### [15. How I converted my React app to VanillaJS (and whether or not it was a terrible idea)](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff)

Smartphone apps have changed the way we used our phones previously. With the growing use of smartphone & its high-end processors, the app also has to perform well to make it worthwhile. You probably have noticed that most of the high performing apps with impressive designs and animations are downloaded the most. It means that if your app is not performing well or it serves lousy user experience, you will be out of the race. It does not just end up losing your valuable customers but also affects your business & its value.

It’s 2021 and JavaScript has taken over the development landscape. At this point there is a JavaScript library or framework for everything. So you have a few different options if you want to send emails directly from your browser side code. For example you can always just include your email handle in a link. If your users have their system set up correctly a simple click will open their email account with your email in the mailto: slot(aka send). However as a developer this seems less than ideal because it requires  that your users have the proper set up to handle the action.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/GyReioOm4SYrQtHDFZYR7Ot7i3w1-r003dd6.gif.webp)

The text typed in the input field was then used to query the API for animes matching the input. The input field was to use “instant search” mechanism. This meant that users where not required to hit enter or press a button for the search to occur. To prevent making a call to the API on every keystroke, I had to debounce the queries made to the API.

I’ve been working with react-redux, and I’m loving it, working with react is awesome, but it can get confusing really fast, so when I was introduced to redux I just instantly loved it.

After a quick google search, I realized the default app uses the @redux/toolkit and I wanted to talk about it because it’s pretty great, so…

React Native is without any doubt a strong and powerful solution. It opens the world of cross-platform app development for a much wider audience of software engineers who aren’t familiar with native technologies. But it might at the same time be quite difficult to implement complex things when you’ve just started learning. In this short tutorial, I want to give a step-by-step guide on how to implement one of them — infinite scroll.

This article is a prequel of sorts to my earlier 110% Complete JWT Authentication with Django & React - 2020 article. That article covers how to get started with JWT authentication in a typical React and Django Rest Framework project, and it does that well enough. There's just one major annoyance with it - I couldn't figure out how to get live reloading working! So for every change made to the frontend, we had to shut down the dev server, rebuild the React bundle, and start it up again. Talk about tedious!

Sometimes we want to implement authentication for multiple reasons and we don't want to create an API just for the authentication or maybe we are not backend developers. That's why Firebase provides authentication backend services easy to use. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular social networks like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

Redux is awesome! But people often complain about how much boilerplate they have to write when working with it. Part of this problem, is because they feel unproductive defining constants, action creators and big reducers, but also because they don’t have a clear idea on how to organize their project, or even how to proper handle async requests. On this post, we are going to talk about those concerns and present some approaches to handle them.

What is "Infrastructure as Code"? If someone checks a bunch of YAML files into a Git repository, do they suddenly become code? That seems more like "Infrastructure as Files" to me. I suppose that's better than infrastructure as a gaggle of shell scripts and some commands run by hand in the middle of the night in a coffee-fueled haze, but it is a far cry from code. How about a system to define infrastructure that really is like code?

As market trends begin to shift towards front-end development, it’s easy to question which JavaScript framework is in demand. Is it React, Angular or Vue? It’s a kind of game that makes you confused about which one you should pick up for your next web development project. It is even more confusing when you are just entering the trade game. A lot of startups and entrepreneurs don’t even realize which one is the right front-end framework for their web project.

The React JS dev team announced some exciting changes several months ago - React would be getting a "Concurrent Mode". Essentially this would allow React to perform multiple UI renders concurrently. Of course, JavaScript is single threaded and true concurrency is an illusion, but the new features will allow web apps (and Native Apps once these features hit React Native) to be much more responsive and snappy than they are now with less effort and custom code from the developer to make this happen.
