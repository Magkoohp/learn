With the advent of Natural Language Processing (NLP), traditional job searches based on static keywords are becoming less desirable because of their inaccuracy and will eventually become obsolete. While the traditional search engine performs simple keyword searches, the NLP based search engine extract named entities, key phrases, sentiment, etc. to enrich the documents with metadata and perform search query based on the extracted metadata. In this tutorial, we will build a model to extract entities, such as skills, diploma and diploma major, from job descriptions using Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Transformer-based models are a game-changer when it comes to using unstructured text data. As of September 2020, the top-performing models in the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark are all BERT transformer-based models. At Georgian, we often encounter scenarios where we have supporting tabular feature information and unstructured text data. We found that by using the tabular data in these models, we could further improve performance, so we set out to build a toolkit that makes it easier for others to do the same.

In machine learning, it is crucial to have a large amount of data in order to achieve strong model performance. Using a method known as data augmentation, you can create more data for your machine learning project. Data augmentation is a collection of techniques that manage the process of automatically generating high-quality data on top of existing data.

Have you ever dreamed of a good transcription tool that would accurately understand what you say and write it down? Not like the automatic YouTube translation tools… I mean, they are good but far from perfect. Just try it out and turn the feature on for the video, and you’ll see what I’m talking about.

The original AI Dungeon was made just over a year ago, the result of a curious gamer, a hackathon, and the GPT-2 text transformer. Fast forward to the present day, and AI Dungeon has expanded into a unique example of creative AI technology. The game now boasts 1.5 million players, multiple genres for stories, and even multiplayer adventures.

In this post we are going to build a web application which will compare the similarity between two documents. We will learn the very basics of natural language processing (NLP) which is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language.

Everything we express (either verbally or in written) carries huge amounts of information. The topic we choose, our tone, our selection of words, everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value extracted from it. In theory, we can understand and even predict human behaviour using that information.

We’ve all heard about GPT-3 and have somewhat of a clear idea of its capabilities. You’ve most certainly seen some applications born strictly due to this model, some of which I covered in a previous video about the model. GPT-3 is a model developed by OpenAI that you can access through a paid API but have no access to the model itself.
