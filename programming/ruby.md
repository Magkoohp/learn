On my journey on Microverse, one of the things that troubled me the most to understand was RSpec, a Ruby gem for Test-Driven Development. The concept is quite simple.

ver open up a Rails console to debug a problem and come away wondering how the data got so funky? Despite our best efforts the database will accept plenty of garbage data if you let it.
