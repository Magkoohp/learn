![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/qb5732ov.png)
Web security is a topic that is often overlooked by frontend developers. When we assess the quality of the website, we often look at metrics like performance, SEO-friendliness, and accessibility, while the website’s capacity to withstand malicious attacks often falls under the radar. And even though the sensitive user data is stored server-side and significant measures must be taken by backend developers to protect the servers, in the end, the responsibility for securing that data is shared between both backend and frontend. While sensitive data may be safely locked in a backend warehouse, the frontend holds the keys to its front door, and stealing them is often the easiest way to gain access.

For the past few years, Frontend developers have shown partiality towards React, with Vue.js and Angular tagging behind closely. Comparative interest in Vue has held back a bit due to the long-awaited and somewhat delayed Vue 3.0 release. Similarly, the interest in Angular has decreased due to the long delay in shipping Ivy (its frontend renderer).

Ever since AWS made a serverless option of AWS RDS Aurora generally available, I’ve been on the edge of my seat, eagerly anticipating all the various possibilities. It would mean a breakthrough in building serverless architectures. No more managing connection pools with SQL. No more worrying about capping out available connections. This would make it viable to use serverless for database intensive operations.

I’ve been working with react-redux, and I’m loving it, working with react is awesome, but it can get confusing really fast, so when I was introduced to redux I just instantly loved it. The thing is… when I created an application using yarn create ract-app --template redux, the app had a different syntax than the one I was taught in all the tutorials I saw on youtube, so I started playing around with the default application, and the way they do things there is cleaner and more straight forward. After a quick google search, I realized the default app uses the @redux/toolkit and I wanted to talk about it because it’s pretty great, so…

In the 1930s, the Toyota Production System gave us lean manufacturing principles. Now, the IT, software and web development industry have also adopted these principles to improve their production processes. In actuality, the concepts and principles of Lean are used in more ways than just in manufacturing. Yet, in IT and software, there are still those who are pointing towards Agile development when they mention Lean and software development in the same context. While it is true that Agile and Lean principles share similar philosophies, there are key differences which set them apart. Diving deep inside Lean, I will discuss what lean talks about other than it’s key points.

Nowadays, as a webdeveloper, you rarely build anything from scratch: your daily job mostly consists of integrating various Javascript libraries together. If you are building a web app you are most likely going to use some framework like React, Vue or Angular for your front-end. To transmit and manage the data you will be using Redux or GraphQL. For the backend, there will be Express and probably Loopback. Then you need to cover everything with tests, so Jest, Mocha or Jasmine must be present too. Finally, there will be UI frameworks like Bootstrap and maybe some charting tools. I have already counted at least 7 core libraries and all of these are in a single project! And what about underlying technologies like Javascript itself, Node.js and, probably, Typescript? Well, that’s a lot!

Redux is awesome! But people often complain about how much boilerplate they have to write when working with it. Part of this problem, is because they feel unproductive defining constants, action creators and big reducers, but also because they don’t have a clear idea on how to organize their project, or even how to proper handle async requests. On this post, we are going to talk about those concerns and present some approaches to handle them.
