Since its advent in 1991, Python has been the choice of coders due to its simple features that include ease of understanding and readability of code but not limited to just that. There have been lots of changes in the codebase over time due to the contribution from developers worldwide. Simple syntax and faster execution make Python a favorable language among programmers. It is used widely to create websites and primarily in big data operations. To make the task of running Python programs easier, many IDEs have been developed for programmers. These environments are equally suitable for beginners and advanced coders with a variety of in-built extensions, libraries, and plugins to ease the task of program execution. Let's walk you through these six IDEs that can ease your work with Python:

Ever had the problem where you submit a pull request and the diff is waaaaay bigger than it should be? The code looks identical but GitHub is telling you that it's all different! This is typically due to a difference in line endings. Unix systems (Linux and Mac) default to the LF (line feed) character for line breaks. Windows on the other hand is "special" and defaults to CR/LF (carriage return AND line feed).

Software development or programming is not easy until you are a hardcore programmer. A while back, programmers had to code on dull command prompt screens, run the code on a separate compiler then debug it on some third platform. Today, although, programming needs the same dedication and efforts, it has become easier to code, compile, and debug in the same environment. All thanks to IDE-Integrated Development Environment platforms, which enable coders to perform all the major functions of programming in one place.
