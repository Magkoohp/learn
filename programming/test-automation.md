After development, the next phase involving quality assurance and testing is crucial to the success of the software. Proper QA testing identifies redundancies, inconsistencies, bugs, and defects in a newly developed product. Without this process, there’s no way to find out the ability of the product to survive in the real world and to work as intended for many years.

Back-end engineering nowadays may require the integration of multiple services. It is painful for engineers to install many services in their local development environment. Docker has provided an easier way to do this, but it will still require some scripting outside our code. It also has not exactly had a perfect solution if we wanted to test smaller functions or classes instead of the whole service. This problem has been addressed by Testcontainers [1].

Identifying element has always been the trickiest part and therefore require an accurate and correct approach. If you are unable to find elements by the easily available approaches like ID, class, name, link or tagname then XPath in Selenium can help rescue you. Locating dynamic elements have always been the pain area while you wish to automate the scripts, the only ray of hope to deal with such fiascos is XPath. In my current article, I will be digging into the steps of locating an element via XPath example in Selenium and its various ways.

Selenium is a widely used tool for automated browser testing. Being an open-source framework allowed Selenium to be compatible with multiple test automation frameworks for different programming languages and if we talk about automation testing with Selenium and JavaScript, there is a particular framework that never fails to take the spotlight and that is the Nightwatch.js. This is why I decided to come up with Nightwatch.js tutorial for beginners.
