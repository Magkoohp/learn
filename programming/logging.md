The story of event logging begins at sea and is related to navigation. One of the important aspects of navigation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning" target="_blank">dead reckoning</a>: estimating your current position based on course, speed and time from a known, observed point. In the end of 15th century, speed at sea was measured with a small wooden log. A so-called ‘Dutchman’s Log’ was dropped overboard from the bow of the ship and the navigator measured the time elapsing before it passed the stern.

Cloudwatch is an AWS service that allows storage and monitoring of your application logs from an array of AWS services. This can be really useful for creating alerts to notify developers when a certain threshold of errors has been hit, but sometimes we might need to deeply analyse our logs, not only to spot errors but to find insights into our application and improve performance. This is where an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack can really outperform Cloudwatch. ELK allows us to collate data from any source, in any format, and to analyse, search and visualise the data in real time.

Logging is one of the most important parts of software systems. Whether you have just started working on a new piece of software, or your system is running in a large scale production environment, you’ll always find yourself seeking help from log files. Logs are the first thing people look for when something goes wrong, or something doesn’t work as expected.

Several years ago, I wanted to have my own performance monitoring solution, so I could monitor all enterprise applications. Few enterprises implement this core cross-cutting application task across the enterprise in the same way. By the phrases “core” and “cross-cutting” I mean a feature or functionality set that touches all application development; it’s not specific to a single application. I think some functionality that is repeated across the enterprise should be done the same standard way.

The concept of instrumentation often refers to tracing where events happen in an application. Many application performance monitoring (APM) tools use it to provide metrics on the inner workings of your application. But sometimes, all you really need are details about API calls.

Heroku differentiates itself from other cloud providers, by offering a complete, cohesive environment. Where AWS and GCP present a decoupled toolkit, Heroku strives for a seamless, UI-driven experience for the user. This philosophy is clearly embodied in its metrics functionality, which is often a single click or basic configuration file away.
