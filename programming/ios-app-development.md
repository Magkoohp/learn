Thanks to the mobile era we have mobile apps for everything these days. Every business from a barber shop to huge retailers has apps so that they can be closer to their customers.

And it becomes very vital when dealing with payments and other sensitive information.

It utilises .reality or .USDZ files, the latter is a file format developed by Pixar, and allows showing objects in incredible detail, adding animations and sounds, locking their scale to 1:1 so models show the real size of an object.
