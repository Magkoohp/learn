Many companies today install various tracking apps on their employees’ computers and check if their team members are productive during the working day.

Cloud computing is becoming more and more of a household name, with even the most conservative fields of business figuring out how to make the best use of it. Cloud computing usually starts with running a private cloud solution on premises before venturing onto the public cloud. Of course, the cloud is not a single uniform being. It may come from different providers, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure being the biggest players here. Or it may come with different visibility and hosting, that is, public (resides with the provider), private (self-hosted), or hybrid (which uses a bit of both). And the cloud can use different tools and APIs for management as well.

![](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/1qXjYEFKRFuVbxRPwfuj)
Node.js monitoring is a tricky task. There are certain challenges to look out for. Because Node.js is a dynamically typed programming language and single-threaded you give the interpreter and runtime a lot of freedom to make decisions. This can easily result in memory leaks and high CPU loads. Parallel execution is simulated in Node.js by using asynchronous execution of functions. But, if a single function blocks the thread or event queue, the application performance will take a huge hit.
