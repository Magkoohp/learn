The debate over comments in code is ongoing. At least once per year for the last 30 years, I‚Äôve been involved in a discussion on the subject - often accidentally and reluctantly. To be honest, my perspective has changed over time. I used to comment every method, I used to comment any line of code that was ‚Äúweird‚Äù, and I used to comment any blocks of code that were too complicated. Today, I rarely comment, if ever. Over time, I‚Äôve come to realize that most comments are unnecessary.

If you want to access data in a distributed environment such as in a microservice architecture, then data services are the way to go. The idea is to create a data abstraction layer (DAL) that the rest of the system‚Äôs applications and services can share. Thus, a data service gives you a generalized interface to the data you‚Äôre exposing and provides access to it in a standard manner. This would be in a well-understood protocol and a known data format. For example, a popular approach is to use JSON via HTTP/S.

Inevitably, we‚Äôll someday come across legacy software, inconsistent databases, or integration modules that simply don‚Äôt work. It might sound wise to fix this software, especially if they‚Äôre crucial to the business. The problem that refactoring costs development and validation time, and the business does not always have this time to invest, but at the same time needs the fix. How can we both deliver the business requirements in time and still not break everything?

Software development goes through six main stages, otherwise known as the software development lifecycle. They are planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. After development, the next phase involving quality assurance and testing is crucial to the success of the software. Proper QA testing identifies redundancies, inconsistencies, bugs, and defects in a newly developed product. Without this process, there‚Äôs no way to find out the ability of the product to survive in the real world and to work as intended for many years.¬†

Ballerina¬†since v1.2.5 has built-in support for¬†Azure Functions. In this way, you can take a Ballerina function and expose it as a serverless function in Azure Functions. Azure Functions take on a unique approach in defining serverless functions with the function trigger and bindings concept. In this way, we can access other cloud services such as storage services (queue, blob, etc.), CosmosDB, Twillio, and timers right from the function itself without any additional connectors or authentication processes. We map our parameters and return types with these bindings, which provides us direct access to the resources.

In software engineering, Creational Design Patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, i.e. try to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic or ordinary form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. In this article of the Creational Design Patterns, we‚Äôre going to take a look at the much-hated & commonly asked design pattern in a programming interview. That is Singleton Design Pattern in Modern C++ which criticizes for its extensibility & testability. I will also cover the Multiton Design Pattern which quite contrary to Singleton.

Well-written multitier applications consist of multiple layers. The most widespread three-tier architecture divides our code into a presentation, business and data access tiers. Like it or not, but the business layer is where we, developers, spend the most time on a daily basis. This is the place where all processes and decisions our application depends on take place. Therefore, requirements for the business layer change more often than in any other layer. What hurts us, developers, most is that with every change, even the smallest ones, we need to recompile and rebuild our app. It usually takes a piece of the valuable time that we could use for more interesting things. What if we could move a business logic out of our code and let non-technician people change it?
