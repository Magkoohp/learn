![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6yr3z5p.jpg)
Idempotency is a strategy that makes sure an event that executed multiple times will give the same result. For example, GET method on the HTTP request. If you calling the endpoint with GET method will give you the same result. But POST method is not idempotent because every time you call an endpoint with POST method will create a new record on the database (the database state changes).

### [38. Most Common Redis Use Cases by Core Data Structures](https://hackernoon.com/top-redis-use-cases-by-core-data-structure-types-3i1v131xc)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/jq1qo31yw.png)
Redis, short for Remote Dictionary Server, is a BSD-licensed, open-source in-memory key-value data structure store written in C language by Salvatore Sanfillipo and was first released on May 10, 2009. Depending on how it is configured, Redis can act like a database, a cache or a message broker. It’s important to note that Redis is a NoSQL database system. This implies that unlike SQL (Structured Query Language) driven database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, Redis does not store data in well-defined database schemas which constitute tables, rows, and columns. Instead, Redis stores data in data structures which makes it very flexible to use. In this blog, we outline the top Redis use cases by the different core data structure types.
