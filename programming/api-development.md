APIs have been around for decades – they allow different systems to talk to each other in a seamless, fast fashion –  yet it’s been during the past decade that this technology has become a significant force.

So then why all the interest in APIs? We all know the usual stories – Uber, Airbnb, Apple Pay…  the list goes on, and the reasons are plentiful.  Today the question is, how?  Perhaps you are looking to differentiate your business or want a first-mover advantage.  How can you execute quickly and at low cost/risk to try new market offerings?

An API provides several benefits to an organisation, but without a dedicated team of trained developers, it might seem like an implausible option. Developers are expensive, and it can take months to develop an API from the ground up. If you don’t fancy outsourcing or have the capability in house to build internal APIs, a low-code platform might just be the answer.
