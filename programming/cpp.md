### [1. Stack Overflow Vulnerability](https://hackernoon.com/stack-overflow-vulnerability-xou2bbm)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ga16d2b43.jpg)
Stack overflow is a type of buffer overflow vulnerability. When we  pour water in a glass more than its capacity the water spills or  overflow, similarly when we enter data in a buffer more than its  capacity the data overflows to adjacent memory location causing program to crash. This is know as buffer overflow.

Security is an eternal race between the techniques and technologies of attackers and those of the defenders. Today, I'm proud to announce a step forward for defenders with a new rule to detect a literal race condition: TOCTOU (or TOCTTOU) vulnerabilities, known in long-form as Time Of Check (to) Time Of Use.

Libraries and system utilities form the foundations on which larger projects are built. So it's critical to make sure they, in particular, are secure. That's why we recently introduced five new rules for C++ and C to detect broken authentication and access control in *nix systems. The new rules fall into three categories: account validity, granting permissions, and changing directories.

All data in computer is represented in binary i.e. in 0 or 1. Computers or machines do not understand our languages, they understand bits. Generally programmer do not care about operations at the bit level. But sometimes a programmer has to dive in a deeper level and work on bits.

In software engineering, Creational Design Patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic or ordinary form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Builder Design Pattern in C++ solves this specific problem by separating the construction of a complex object from its representation.

C was developed and promoted by Dennis Ritchie in the years between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs. C++ came into existence around 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ was created as an enrichment to the C programming language, and initially, it was named "C with Classes."

When writing a rule for static analysis, it’s possible that in some cases, the rule does not give the results that were expected. Unfortunately, naming a false positive is often far easier than fixing it. In this post, I’ll discuss how the different types of rules give rise to different types of false positives, which ones are easier to fix than others, and how you can help. I’ll end with insight into how issues that are false positives can still be true indicators that the code needs to change.

In software engineering, Creational Design Patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, i.e. try to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic or ordinary form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. In this article of the Creational Design Patterns, we’re going to take a look at the much-hated & commonly asked design pattern in a programming interview. That is Singleton Design Pattern in Modern C++ which criticizes for its extensibility & testability. I will also cover the Multiton Design Pattern which quite contrary to Singleton.

Prototype Design Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that helps in the prototyping(creating/copying cheaply) of an object using separate methods or polymorphic classes. You can consider the prototype as a template of an object before the actual object is constructed. In this article of the Creational Design Patterns, we’re going to take a look at why we need a Prototype Design Pattern in C++ i.e. motivation, prototype factory & leveraging prototype design pattern to implement virtual copy constructor.

From C++11, std::tuple is an incredible expansion to Modern C++, that offers a fixed-size col­lec­tion of het­ero­ge­neous values. Un­for­tu­nately, tu­ples can be somewhat dubious to manage in a conventional fash­ion. But, subsequently released C++ stan­dard in­tro­duced a few fea­tures & helpers that greatly re­duce the nec­es­sary boil­er­plate. So, in this article, I will explain the variadic template in C++ with the help of unsophisticated tuple 
implementation. And also walks you through a tricky part of tuple i.e. 
loop through tuple element. In spite of the fact that I have shrouded the variadic template in my prior article i.e. C++ Template: A Quick UpToDate Look. So, my focus here would be a blend of variadic template & tuple  implementation with more up to date C++ gauges.

Interface Segregation Principle in C++ is the fourth & by far the simplest design principle of a series SOLID as a Rock design principles. The SOLID design principles focus on developing software that is easy to maintainable, reusable & extendable. In this article, we will see a code violating ISP, a solution to the same code, guideline & benefits of ISP.

Another year is drawing to an end, and it's a perfect time to make yourself a cup of coffee and reread the reviews of bugs collected across open-source projects over this year. This would take quite a while, of course, so we prepared this article to make it easier for you. Today we'll be recalling the most interesting dark spots that we came across in open-source C/C++ projects in 2019.

### [51. Fixing Code Errors in Amnesia: The Dark Descent](https://hackernoon.com/fixing-code-errors-in-amnesia-the-dark-descent-e0363wpg)

Just before the release of the "Amnesia: Rebirth" game, the vendor "Fractional Games" opened the source code of the legendary "Amnesia: The Dark Descent" and its sequel "Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs". Why not use the static analysis tool to see what dreadful mistakes are hidden in the inside of these cult horror games?

### [52. C++ Type Casting for C Developers](https://hackernoon.com/c-type-casting-for-c-developers-0c823y9k)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/w01232lk.jpg)
The typecasting is the feature which makes C++ more type-safe, robust & may convince you to use it over C. But this is also a more underrated topic when you are a newbie or moving from C background. Hence, I come up with an article on it. Here, we will not only see the C++ type casting with example for C developers but we will also cover Why do we need typecasting? & C++ type casting cheat codes for C developers to remember & employ it easily. 

### [53. 7 best practices for exception handling in C++](https://hackernoon.com/7-best-practices-for-exception-handling-in-c-561k32e0)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/v060q3zbm.png)
Exception handling in C++ is a well-unschooled topic if you observe initial stages of the learning curve. There are numerous tutorials available online on exception handling in C++ with example. But few explains what you should not do & intricacies around it. So here, we will see some intricacies, from where & why you should not throw an exception along with some newer features introduced in Modern C++ on exception handling with example. I am not an expert but this is what I have gained from various sources, courses & industry experiences.

So I have started updating myself with Modern C++ a while ago & since my post 21 new features of Modern C++ to use in your project & All about lambda function in C++ was popular I decided to write about advanced C++ concepts & idioms which I have learned from this wikibook & course.

### [55. Machine Learning in Static Code Analysis](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-in-static-code-analysis-0t293w3p)

Machine learning has firmly entrenched in a variety of human fields, from speech recognition to medical diagnosing. The popularity of this approach is so great that people try to use it wherever they can. Some attempts to replace classical approaches with neural networks turn up unsuccessful. This time we'll consider machine learning in terms of creating effective static code analyzers for finding bugs and potential vulnerabilities.
