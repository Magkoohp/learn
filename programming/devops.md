When we started with Kubernetes, around June 2018, the most popular choice on AWS was kops. But later down the road we migrated to the managed solution provided by AWS: EKS. I think it happened around the time when AWS announced PCI and ISO compliance and it also helped that meanwhile the managed platform was becoming available in more and more regions (because in the summer of 2018 you could use it only in very few locations).

China is a massive internet and mobile-based internet market. China's cloud needs are growing at high speed. Still, the government’s long-standing protectionist policies, foreign cloud service providers face significant challenges competing with Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba Cloud and others. China acts differently when it comes to cloud and DevOps practices. While the whole world embraces AWS, Microsoft, Google for their cloud-related needs, that is not the case when it comes to China, Alibaba seems a clear winner of the most market share followed by Tencent Cloud, Baidu Cloud, and others.

If Kubernetes is the pilot that steers the ship, then Helm Charts are the navigational maps that guide the journey correctly. We have seen this happening over the years in the world of software development, one tool comes with an idea, serves the purpose, and becomes obsolete in some years, and then one more tool gets introduced that replaces the old approach, and this journey continues.

So recently we had a problem. We’ve started building a micro-service based e-commerce platform that communicates using azure service bus. Unfortunately, we found that setting up azure functions with a service bus trigger either ended up with a lot of code to maintain or a lot of deployment pipelines. It was getting to be a pain, so we looked for an alternative which we found with logic apps and a bootstrapper function which I’ll take you through how to implement.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/e75t2dsn.jpg)
What is "Infrastructure as Code"? If someone checks a bunch of YAML files into a Git repository, do they suddenly become code? That seems more like "Infrastructure as Files" to me. I suppose that's better than infrastructure as a gaggle of shell scripts and some commands run by hand in the middle of the night in a coffee-fueled haze, but it is a far cry from code. How about a system to define infrastructure that really is like code?

One of the last questions asked in a DevOps interview is usually "so, what does DevOps mean to you?" I think this is a smart question, because DevOps is wildly misunderstood by the greater IT community. Some may answer that it's Continuous Integration and Releases, another may say it's having everything in Git, and the last might say that it's having tests available. All of these technical solutions do represent a key aspect of DevOps which is the tool chain, but it is the least important.

The software development life-cycle has a lot of moving parts. A huge problem many large companies have is maintaining a consistent deployment process. Written steps sometimes get skipped; manual deploys are error prone, and home-grown deploy scripts are usually only understood by the person that wrote them. Companies like Netflix, Etsy, and Amazon need to make sure that deployment cycles are smooth and errors are caught as early in the process as possible.

Production issues are never fun. They always seem to happen when you’re not at work, and the cause always seems to be silly. We recently had issues in our production Kubernetes cluster with nodes running out of memory, but the node recovered very quickly without any noticeable interruptions. In this story we will go over the specific issue that happened in our cluster, what the impact was, and how we will avoid this issue in the future.

Shorter development cycles and faster innovation are the basic characteristics of the DevOps model. It has swept the market with new ideas and incredible solutions, leading to 74% adoption by global enterprises. The reasons are different, but the top ones are the ability to recover from a failure in less than 60 minutes, minimization of support cases by 37%, and overall need to “put out fires”. No wonder that Quality Assurance, as a stage of the software development process, had to adapt to the new reality of the DevOps model and change its traditional approaches.

DevSecOps is the new buzz and definitely a potential candidate to scare people in the ever-changing software industry. When I heard the term for the first time, my inner voice said it out loud, "When just this Happened, and why SEC is sandwich between them ?". Later on, to look cool, I started adding DevSecOps on my profile, but the dire consequence was a complete disappointment. DevSecOps isn't just restricted to understand security by heart & fit it with DevOps. A good analogy would be not to imagine your ex with someone, especially with your girlfriend/wife. It is all about "Shift left on Security" i.e. to introduce security as early as possible in the SDLC. Though I am not going to bore you with the definitions and concepts as I am a practical person. Thus, my objective here is to demonstrate how DevSecOps works in reality. The following series split into two parts (refer below) with very simple and clear instructions to provision a CI/CD pipeline adhering to DevSecOps principles in AWS. Everything covered from scratch you won't face any difficulty understanding. In case of any clarification, drop me a note on LinkedIn.

Also besides backing up data, the snapshot api also comes in handy for migrating data from one cluster to another.

Ah yes—“It works fine on my machine!” Perhaps the most famous saying in our industry. Even with the advent of containers that provide consistent environments across the SDLC, we still hear developers fall back to this claim when a defect is found. But in the end, if the code doesn't work in test or production, it doesn't work—even if it works locally. So as a developer, being able to deep dive into your containerized application to fix the problem—regardless of the environment—is a critical skill we must all learn.

DevOps, the term seems a buzz word for many from the last few years, but this buzzword is the most searched term on the internet by IT recruiters, software firms, and agencies. When it comes to DevOps, the pro enthusiasts argue saying it is never about the tools or automation, but they miss to see that, in fact, tools are the ones that take over the culture ones the DevOps culture is set in any firm. We all agree DevOps is not only about the tools, nor even an individual role, perhaps, it should be a group effort, DevOps is a trinity of people, process and tools. But to enable DevOps, in any organization, DevOps tools play a vital role.

Application deployment comprises the steps, processes, and activities required to make an application or update available for its intended users. The manner in which you deploy an application matters a great deal as it impacts how quickly your product will respond to changes, and the quality of these changes. Today, most software developers deploy updates, patches, and new applications via a combination of manual, automated, and cloud-based processes, although, manual application deployment is being phased out.

The concept of a microservice perfectly fits the structure of a serverless function, which easily enables deployment and runtime isolation for different services. On the storage side, services such as DynamoDB also make it easier to have independent databases for each microservice and scale them independently (when required or desirable).

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/9j1a3yra.png)
Earlier, developers simply wrote their program, built it and ran it. Today, developers need to also think of the various ways of running it whether it be as a binary on a machine (virtual most likely), by packaging it into a container, by making that container a part of a bigger deployment (K8s) or by deploying it into a serverless environment or a service mesh. However, these deployment options are not part of the programming experience for a developer. The developer has to write code in a certain way to work well in a given execution environment, and removing this from the programming problem isn’t good.

At the beginning of developing and building a new application or product, before writing any business logic, it's necessary to make some difficult decisions. These decisions can include which cloud hosting platform to use, which continuous integration (CI) tool to use, and various development configuration choices. These decisions can dictate the speed and success of your engineering efforts. Therefore, choosing the right CI tool can make or break the velocity and quality of a team's code production.
