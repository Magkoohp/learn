![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/42i32hn.png)
Recently I came across the issue of using the auth module in Nuxt.js and invoking a $router.push in subsequent line of code in the same method. The conundrum began when the lines after the auth.loginWith method did not execute as intended since the page was redirected to the redirect URI.

Bulma is a free, open-source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 200,000 developers. It's the easiest to learn (my opinion) due to its natural naming of classes and a simple grid system. It's not that popular like Bootstrap, but it got a specific fanbase.

A good example for this case will be, when you are building an application for multiple countries. TLDR; Different countries might have different requirements i.e different sections or different form fields, but the base application i.e common part should remain same.

The React Context API provides a way to share properties that are required by many components (e.g., user settings, UI theme) without having to pass a prop through every level of the tree (aka prop drilling). Although Vue.js does not provide the same abstraction out of the box, in this article, we’ll see that in Vue 3, we have all the tools we need to replicate the same functionality quickly.

In single-page apps that use the Vue Router, it is common to create a path parameter that changes the behavior of a route.
