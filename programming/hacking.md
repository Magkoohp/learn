The Badger DAO attack was conceptually very different from the more traditional attack in DeFi. Those traditional ones are aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in the code of smart contracts of the protocols, otherwise called bugs. We are familiar with flash loan attacks that use uncollateralised loans across a multitude of protocols to manipulate certain markets and pump-and-dump certain assets. We also know about reentrancy attacks that exploit the logic of execution of functions inside a smart contract. However, the Badger DAO exploit was both more and less ingenious at once.

Technology has many advantages to offer businesses, but it also presents unique threats. Cyberattacks are levied at businesses and consumers alike, but companies are often directly targeted. This is because companies deal with large amounts of valuable data, including the personal information of customers and clients, and that can make for a veritable treasure trove for hackers. Protecting your company and your customers from bad actors on the world wide web should be a major priority. Here’s what you need to know.

With the rise in popularity of security-oriented Linux distros like Parrot OS and Kali Linux, complete with their bundles of offensive security tools and no shortage of guides on YouTube and HackForums on how to use them, it seems like anyone can be a “hacker” nowadays. It doesn’t take any skill, or even knowledge, to fire up a tool like Wifite or Fern to try breaking into a poorly secured wifi network, but if you’re dependent upon a handful of tools written by people more knowledgeable than yourself, you won’t be successful on real-life red-team engagements with an actual IDS instead of a router left on default settings by a clueless, underpaid employee.

Fernando Corbato pioneered the first computer password in 1960, being used as a personal point of entry on MIT's Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). Just 2 years later, the CTSS was hacked and has been inspiring hackers ever since. There have been immense technological advancements since 1962 - how is it that today's hackers can get through 2-step authentication, biometrics, and security questions? Cryptographers predict a future that moves beyond passwords, but the issue seems to lie between cybersecurity and human nature.

Today’s modern world is, undoubtedly, not a safe haven for any business. Make no mistake, even running a small-time operation or setting up a niche venture can become challenging. But surprisingly enough, the major brands like Sony or top cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance aren’t under the greatest threat - criminals and hackers mostly see their prey under a much lower grade. Network security is one of the stumbling stones for businesses of any scale nowadays. Digital age fraudsters rarely engage in assaulting the top corporations - the largest chunk of their bounty comes from the companies that would never make it to the Forbes list.

Cyber attacks are becoming something of an everyday practice lately. This has grown into a huge problem since unsecured accounts are usually subject to malicious attacks, which result in the theft of assets. The higher the value of assets the more interest hackers have and the more cybersecurity is required. The issue is increasingly true for brokerages, which deal with traders that are moving lots of money through their accounts. This prompted lots of firms to review their cybersecurity standards and start working on the betterment of the system as a whole. This is in the face of the popularity of breaches and exploitations of security vulnerabilities. Not a week goes by without headlines lighting up with new and terrifying data leaks. As a rule of thumb in the cybersecurity industry if the website has not been attacked it is just a matter of time until it will. Thus, it is important to make sure every aspect of the cybersecurity is covered and fully taken care of.
