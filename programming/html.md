If you haven’t used a precompiler before, you are about to fall in love. When you first learn CSS, you learn it stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is pretty accurate.

You could write a very specific CSS file without repeating so much. When I learned about this, I thought I was dreaming. When I learned how to do it, I promised myself I would never go back to simple CSS if I could help it.

The first time I came across bootstrap was when I was working on the front-end libraries curriculum on freeCodeCamp. I learned that it was a powerful framework that can be used to easily build responsive website designs. I didn’t understand how bootstrap worked under the hood, all I knew then was that when you do something like add a class of "img-responsive" to an image, it resizes itself when the screen size changes. Or that when you add a class of “btn btn-default” to a button element, it automatically styles the button and gives it color.

Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript as well as HTML applications. It grabs modular pieces of code compartmentalized in folders. Followed by reconstituting them into a compiled form. Then it's read as a whole by the application. You must be thinking, "Why break up a working code?" As your code scales, so does its complexity. Finding a correlation between each block becomes a challenge.
