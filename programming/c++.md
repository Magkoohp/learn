![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/l8xo2bex.jpg)
We all know that Data structures and Algorithms are the backbone of every concept we use. There are many concepts involved in Data structures and algorithms (for the sake of convenience, I'll use DSA). There will be many questions for a beginner like how to start learning DSA, as there are many concepts involved and he/she might get confused at the start. In this post, we are going to see a roadmap for learning DSA, which worked out for my friends. I am not saying that this is the perfect roadmap for DSA. You can use your own plans also but this is just an idea. So let's get started.

The Rust programming language is an ambitious project of the Mozilla Foundation – a language that claims to be the next step in evolution of C and C++. Over the years of existence of these languages some of their basic flaws still haven’t been fixed, like segmentation errors, manual memory control, risks of memory leaks and unpredictable compiler behavior. Rust was created to solve these problems while improving security and performance along the way.

You probably have heard of the idea of out-of-order execution, and that it breaks some common-sense assumptions about writing programs, and software has to insert barriers to make things right. That was a baffling concept to me at least when I heard of it. At the very least, why would the hardware want to execute out of order only to have the software correct the behavior back? What's the point? Is the software taking care of all the quirks for me?  And if not, where's the catch?

The answer to "What exactly nullptr is in C++?" would be a piece of cake for experienced C++ eyes & for those who are aware of Modern C++ i.e. keyword. But nullptr is more than just a keyword in C++ & to explain that, I have written this article. But before jump-into it, we will see issues with NULL & then we'll dive into the unsophisticated implementation of  nullptr & some use-cases of nullptr.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/w01232lk.jpg)
The typecasting is the feature which makes C++ more type-safe, robust & may convince you to use it over C. But this is also a more underrated topic when you are a newbie or moving from C background. Hence, I come up with an article on it. Here, we will not only see the C++ type casting with example for C developers but we will also cover Why do we need typecasting? & C++ type casting cheat codes for C developers to remember & employ it easily.

Competitive Programming is an art form. It is creative problem solving at its finest, a combination of hard analytical thinking and creativity. Competitive programmers use their knowledge of algorithms and data structures and logical reasoning skills to solve challenging algorithmic problems in a limited time frame.

The American company Electronic Arts Inc (EA) has made the source code of the games Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn and Command & Conquer: Red Alert publicly available. This code should help the game community to develop mods and maps, create custom units, and customize the gameplay logic. We all now have a unique opportunity to plunge into the history of development, which is very different from the modern one.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/qeIv6rNygoYrUXBwG7uA2lPpLSj2-yt4c33tk.jpeg)
In the era of non-stop personal development, more and more software engineers choose to become competent in the second or even the third programming language to gain more experience and access more career opportunities. If you are a C++ developer who’s looking for a second programming language to master, it makes sense to add Java to your skills cloud. Next, I will explain to you how long it takes to learn Java for C++ programmers and why you should go for it.

### [72. Variadic Template in C++: Implementing Unsophisticated Tuple](https://hackernoon.com/variadic-template-in-c-implementing-unsophisticated-tuple-w8153ump)

From C++11, std::tuple is an incredible expansion to Modern C++, that offers a fixed-size col­lec­tion of het­ero­ge­neous values. Un­for­tu­nately, tu­ples can be somewhat dubious to manage in a conventional fash­ion. But, subsequently released C++ stan­dard in­tro­duced a few fea­tures & helpers that greatly re­duce the nec­es­sary boil­er­plate. So, in this article, I will explain the variadic template in C++ with the help of unsophisticated tuple 
implementation. And also walks you through a tricky part of tuple i.e. 
loop through tuple element. In spite of the fact that I have shrouded the variadic template in my prior article i.e. C++ Template: A Quick UpToDate Look. So, my focus here would be a blend of variadic template & tuple  implementation with more up to date C++ gauges.

Another year is drawing to an end, and it's a perfect time to make yourself a cup of coffee and reread the reviews of bugs collected across open-source projects over this year. This would take quite a while, of course, so we prepared this article to make it easier for you. Today we'll be recalling the most interesting dark spots that we came across in open-source C/C++ projects in 2019.

I know, it’s been a while since the last time I published something newbies-friendly on my blog. The main reason is that most of my readers are either experienced devs or from C background having modest C++ encounter. But while programming in C++ you need a completely different mindset as both C & C++ belongs to different programming paradigm. And I always strive to show them a better way of doing things in C++. Anyway, I found the topic which is lengthy, reasonably complex(at least it was for me), newbies-friendly as well as energizing for experienced folks(if Modern C++ jargons, rules & features added) i.e. C++ Template.

Machine learning has firmly entrenched in a variety of human fields, from speech recognition to medical diagnosing. The popularity of this approach is so great that people try to use it wherever they can. Some attempts to replace classical approaches with neural networks turn up unsuccessful. This time we'll consider machine learning in terms of creating effective static code analyzers for finding bugs and potential vulnerabilities.
