![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/chat-bot-clcsiqcgq000101s60qksc0p8.png)
C﻿hatGPD is one of the most common misspellings of the viral language model developed by Open AI. The correct term is ChatGPT.

Nothing excites business owners more than the opportunities to cut cost. So it’s no surprise that in the era of chatbots, many customer service organizations are jumping at the opportunity to show human agents the door.

There are tons of audio recording apps in the app store, but you know things will be a bit different if Google developed a brand new one. Google recently released a new ‘Recorder’ app that is powered by its state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithm that can transcribe what it hears with impressive precision in real-time. This is not the first time Google tried to bless its product with some AI ‘superpower’. Some of their prior attempts failed (I’m talking to you Google Clips!) and some had quite formidable success, for example, Google’s Pixel phone camera app.

 TL;DR; GPT-3 will not take your programming job (Unless you are a terrible programmer, in which case you would have lost your job anyway)

In the realm of AI development, there's perhaps no more important goal than to create systems that can truly master natural language processing (NLP). That's the key to making AI broadly useful, as it will need to interact with humans (who lack the programming skills to speak machine languages). On the path to NLP, it's fair to say that getting an AI to speak human languages is a prerequisite to getting them to understand what people are saying.

### [124. Conferencing and The Art of 'Paper Blitzing'](https://hackernoon.com/paper-blitz-acl-2022-round-ups)

You might be wondering if machines are a threat to the world we live in, or if they’re just another tool in our quest to improve ourselves. If you think that AI is just another tool, you might be surprised to hear that some of the biggest names in technology have a clear concern for it. As Mark Ralston wrote, “The great fear of machine intelligence is that it may take over our jobs, our economies, and our governments”.

### [132. Exploring T5 Model : Text to Text Transfer Transformer Model ](https://hackernoon.com/exploring-t5-model-text-to-text-transfer-transformer-model-4mc03v3z)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nd15v29ad.jpg)
Recent years have seen a plethora of pre-trained models such as ULMFiT, BERT, GPT,  etc being open-sourced to the NLP community. Given the size of such humungous models, it's nearly impossible to train such networks from scratch considering the amount of data and computation that is required.  This is where a new learning paradigm "Transfer Learning" kicks in. Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. 

### [133. A Comparison of GPT-3 and Existing Conversational AI Solutions](https://hackernoon.com/a-comparison-of-gpt-3-and-existing-conversational-ai-solutions-0q2z3z9x)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/GPWtDVRw0oWCLyyZB3TTzZ7tkpD3-c02431ri.jpeg)
Earlier this year, Elon Musk-backed artificial intelligence laboratory, OpenAI, released its latest, much anticipated autoregressive language model, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). Emerging to much fanfare and slated as the usherer of a new age of artificial intelligence, the number of articles, blog posts, and news pieces about this language model, perhaps match only the number of parameters the GPT-3 learned; 175 billion (Ok, this may be an exaggeration, but you get my point).

<TLDR> BERT is certainly a significant step forward in the context of NLP. Business activities such as topic detection and sentiment analysis will be much easier to create and execute, and the results much more accurate. But how did you get to BERT, and how exactly does the model work? Why is it so powerful? Last but not least, what benefits it can bring to the business, and our decision to integrate it into the sandsiv+ Customer Experience platform.</TLDR>

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/m311z36uy.png)
Everything we express (either verbally or in written) carries huge amounts of information. The topic we choose, our tone, our selection of words, everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value extracted from it. In theory, we can understand and even predict human behaviour using that information.

Is Bitcoin the revolution against unequal economic systems, or a scam and money laundry mechanism? Will artificial intelligence (AI) improve and boost humankind, or terminate our species? These questions present incompatible scenarios, but you will find supporters for all of them. They cannot be all right, so who’s wrong then?
