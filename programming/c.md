![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/0dzd3o6g.jpg)
Explicit Interface Implementation is a complex and rarely used technique that allows a single class to inherit from multiple interfaces that have the same method signature. Explicitly implementing each interface, prepending the interface name to the method, allows the same method signature to exist in the same class. I shall not demonstrate that here, but there are plenty of examples of this online. There is another benefit to explicitly implementing an interface, and that is to hide members from being accessed via the class reference. I’ll create an example of this technique using a factory design pattern and Fruit class and a console application that you can step through via F11. If you create a new C# console application in Visual Studio, then copy and paste all of the below code, you can step through (F11) the code to see how it works.

This is know as buffer overflow.

Libraries and system utilities form the foundations on which larger projects are built. So it's critical to make sure they, in particular, are secure. That's why we recently introduced five new rules for C++ and C to detect broken authentication and access control in *nix systems. The new rules fall into three categories: account validity, granting permissions, and changing directories.

I originally wrote this article for a print magazine in 1986. I was 23 and had been doing COBOL for four years, originally on punched cards. I’d started hearing about C and taught it to myself and rewrote a bit of COBOL into C (note, C is a terrible replacement for COBOL) and I wrote this as a primer to other COBOL programmers to get a taste of C. I updated the intro about 10 years ago for a blog post, but in the past 2 weeks I’ve ended up sharing it with a half dozen people who had no understanding of COBOL, simply so I could describe COBOL record structures to them, which I feel are quite powerful and not represented as well in most modern languages. This plays into a new language that I’m currently designing, so enjoy this blast from the past and learn about what your Grandparents were doing “back in the day” :).
