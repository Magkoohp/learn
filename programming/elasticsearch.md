Running systems in production involve requirements for high availability, resilience and recovery from failure. When running cloud-native applications this becomes even more critical, as the base assumption in such environments is that compute nodes will suffer outages, Kubernetes nodes will go down and microservices instances are likely to fail, yet the service is expected to remain up and running.

Elastic APM is extensively useful in monitoring the lifecycle of a HTTP request in a system especially in µservices architecture. Wide variety of web frameworks and databases are supported which is useful in tracking the request up to DB calls. The documentation is simple and concise which makes it easy to instrument the application.

This article aims to help or at least make it easy to trace the HTTP request lifecycle after instrumentation. Golang is used in this article for code snippets but the concept can be extended to other languages as well.

One of my favourite areas of cybersecurity is SIEM (Security Incident Event Management). In 2017 I wrote a post on how I got a role in cyber security, one of my recommendations was using the Elastic Stack as a SIEM as a start-off point for those looking to understand log analysis and how to investigate incidents. But one of the main gripes people had was, where can they get data to work on in their home environments. This post will focus on setting up a honeypot that already utilises the ELK Stack…

### [17. Let's Export Cloudwatch Logs to ELK](https://hackernoon.com/lets-export-cloudwatch-logs-to-elk-f0y3u8z)
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FWmL2MRsrm3fI0vrGJnbbU3EEawS2-zb5y3uzp.jpeg?alt=media&token=14b34ba1-1591-4785-9c03-65ec57e31fcb)
Cloudwatch is an AWS service that allows storage and monitoring of your application logs from an array of AWS services. This can be really useful for creating alerts to notify developers when a certain threshold of errors has been hit, but sometimes we might need to deeply analyse our logs, not only to spot errors but to find insights into our application and improve performance. This is where an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack can really outperform Cloudwatch. ELK allows us to collate data from any source, in any format, and to analyse, search and visualise the data in real time.
