In this blog, I am going to discuss REST API, what is Rest API, what is the use of REST API and how it works. So I hope you will get some idea about the REST API after reading this blog.

### [3. How To Build An API Without Coding [Python]](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-an-api-without-coding-bgs3wlj)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7b3vb3wu9.jpg)
I’ve spent the last 10 years of my life as a System Engineer, which means when I first had to build an API, I had no idea how to do it. I knew python quite a bit since as a SysAdmin I often had to write some smaller or bigger scripts, but building the whole API was a challenge for me. Sure — I could just google the phrase and find dozens of tutorials on how to build an API, but all of them were somehow complicated or created for raw developers (which means — with assumptions that you know already all the tools and frameworks that developers use). 

### [4. Another approach to design API for improved performance!](https://hackernoon.com/improve-app-performance-by-fetching-multiple-resources-in-a-single-api-call-z01b132ay)
![](drafts/4m1hw32q8.png)
GraphQL is an amazing specification, no doubt about that. I loved it when it first came into my knowledge but as I started learning it, well, I started to hate it and I still do at some extent because I am still learning it. So much boilerplate code to even starting the graphQL server.

Swell is a cross-platform compatible (Mac, Linux, & Windows) desktop application and the leading API dev tool for testing and visualizing steaming TCP connections (ie WebSockets, SSEs, GraphQL subscriptions). Swell functions similarly to Postman, but with the added perks of full streaming and GraphQL support. Being an Open Source project, Swell is 100% free and open to outside contributions.

### [6. How to Design API Analytics Data Collection for High Volume APIs](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-design-api-analytics-data-collection-for-high-volume-apis-8k9x3yod)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uscy3yox.jpg)
API Analytics are key for any platform company that wants to gain insights into their API and platform usage. These insights can be leveraged by product owners, growth teams, developer relations, and more to make more strategic decisions based on the raw health of your platform business rather than just gut feelings. However, many API platforms have a very high volume of API calls per day. This volume creates a set of unique challenges when designing an analytics system that scales without crippling their platform or having sticker shock when looking at their cloud vendor’s bill. This post goes into some of the inner workings of how we designs Moesif’s API analytics platform to handle companies with billions of API calls a day.

Recently, I worked with my team at Postman to field the 2020 State of the API survey and report. We’re insanely grateful to the folks who participated—more than 13,500 developers and other professionals took the survey, helping make this the largest and most comprehensive survey in the industry. (Seriously folks, thank you!) Curious what we learned? Here are a few insights in areas that you might find interesting:

Before the pandemic, the crypto startup scene had a nemesis: lacking demand. In 2021, this changed radically—the number of people leveraging cryptocurrencies reached almost 300 million, and venture capitalists invested a record $25.2 billion in blockchain companies, an eight-fold increase from the previous year, according to a new CB Insights report.

APIs can be as simple as 1 endpoint for use by 100s of users or as complex as the AWS APIs with 1000s of endpoints and 100s of thousands of users. Building them can mean spending a couple of hours using a low-code platform or months of work using a multitude of tools. Hosting them can be as simple as using one platform that does everything we need or as complex as setting up and managing ingress control, security, caching, failover, metrics, scaling etc.

How ubiquitous are APIs in today’s development processes? Try asking an engineer how many APIs their project integrates. Most teams won’t know the answer. From analytics tools to maps and cloud hosting, modern applications use a hefty collection of internal and public APIs. Developers use these to quickly assemble applications that would otherwise take much more effort to build. However, there’s a forgotten expense not typically calculated early in a project.
