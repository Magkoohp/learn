Are you trying to decide if you should use MongoDB or DocumentDB? With the recent controversy surrounding licensing with MongoDB, it can be confusing to decide which option is right for your company or project. Amazon decided the core MongoDB code is challenging to scale while remaining highly available. Amazon wrote their implementation, which is compatible with the Apache 2.0 open source MongoDB 3.6 API. MongoDB, Inc. has also recently changed their license to make future imitations more difficult. To do this, they created an entirely new license called the Server Side Public License.

Today there are hundreds of SQL and NoSQL databases. Some of them are popular, some are ignored. Some are user-friendly and well documented and some are hard to use. Some are open sourced and some are proprietary. And, perhaps, the most important - some are scalable, optimized, highly available and some are difficult to scale or maintain.

What is Coronavirus (COVID-19)?

Coronavirus (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by respiratory illness and symptoms like flu, cough, fever, difficulty breathing, on December 31, 2019, the first case was recorded in Wuhan, China and later the virus got spread around the world and as of now, around 1 million+ confirmed cases are being recorded since then.

You can protect yourself from this virus by following basic precautions like washing your hand frequently, avoid touching your face, maintaining a distance of (1 meter or 3 feet) between people and most importantly if you are sick then immediately call for medical help at your nearest hospital.

Here, we have four roles: Sme, Sponsor, Admin, Operations.Initially, we had only 3 roles.Operations role was added later and Operations user has permissions similar to the Admin user.In the code, we had to replace every instance of if (user.type == USER_TYPES.ADMIN) with if (user.type == USER_TYPES.ADMIN || user.type == USER_TYPES.OPERATIONS).As this is time consuming and we can also miss many instances, we have created a roles module. In the roles module,the roles are defined along with their respective permissions as seen in Code (Part-III). Based on the permissions for each role, we will evaluate the authorization for the user in each of our controller methods.If the user has access, only then he will be granted the resources.

Learning MongoDB has been one of the things in my checklist for the past 6 months but hasn’t gotten around actually learning it until now. In order to understand writing queries and all I figured it’ll be better to make something instead of just reading and watching some tutorials. So, I’ve decided to make a user registration API i.e, a simple registration form kinda thing with only sign up and sign in functions as of now. As learning Mongo was the main intention, I’ve decided just to make the core app which is the backend functionality and no front end as it’s not necessary and I hate to do it.
