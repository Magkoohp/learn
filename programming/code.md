![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/MUo6MihNAVUIcUvRBbcToKZ7MKh1-tv93izk.jpeg)
As a tech enthusiast and programmer, I love trying new platforms that attempt to reinvent the way we interact with computers, the internet, and each other. One of the most outdated yet crucial tools we interact with every day — the search engine — is due for disruption. Many companies recognize this and have tried to redesign and reinvent the search process. To stay at the forefront of this search engine revolution and take control over my search results, I experimented with several smaller search engines (most still in beta). One of the most innovative and curated alternative search engines is You.com. In my opinion, their recent release of YouCode has the potential to reshape how programmers interact with the internet, expedite problem solving, and enhance software design. Today I will be reviewing this novel search engine and discussing how I use it to improve my coding.
