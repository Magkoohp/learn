If you haven‚Äôt used a precompiler before, you are about to fall in love. When you first learn CSS, you learn it stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is pretty accurate. Whatever property you change twice, it will be overridden by the latest line. Because of this, CSS involves a lot of repetition and specification. Either via classes, IDs or selectors you have to show the browser exactly what you want to style. But what if I told you this could be easier? You could write a very specific CSS file without repeating so much. When I learned about this, I thought I was dreaming. When I learned how to do it, I promised myself I would never go back to simple CSS if I could help it.

The first thing you‚Äôll notice when you add a button to your website is that you‚Äôve taken a trip back in time to 1999.

Cascading style sheets ordinarily known as CSS is a language that illustrates how the elements of the HTML are to be presented on any media. CSS was proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. Several other style sheet languages were proposed at about the same time for the web. But the first one to be introduced was CSS1 and it was introduced in 1996.

Through time has been common to compare things that can do similar functions, for the sake of electing a champion, something that is better, be it reason "y" or reason "x", and specially to be on the "right" side.

Choosing the right CSS selectors can be a lot of trouble and there‚Äôs so much information out there that it can even be a little overwhelming at times. Words like ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù and ‚Äúspecificity‚Äù get thrown around a lot, you read how greater specificity increases efficiency but then how ID‚Äôs (the most specific) should be avoided like the plague, according to some. What‚Äôs a poor coder to do as he navigates the cascading landscape of style sheets? Hopefully by the end of this I will have been able to outline some good practices, and provide enough additional resources, to clear this issue up for good.
