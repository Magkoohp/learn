If you are familiar with Docker, Terraform, and the CI platforms (eg: Jenkins, CircleCI, Codeship), you already know the power of Declarative DevOps. It can make development easier by being repeatable, predictable, and fast. Supporting technologies both hide complexities and offer important reuse by supporting simple structured syntax in an easy to create and read file. Each technology has codified much of its domain allowing developers to author and instrument with nothing more than a text editor.
