Well-written multitier applications consist of multiple layers. The most widespread three-tier architecture divides our code into a presentation, business and data access tiers. Like it or not, but the business layer is where we, developers, spend the most time on a daily basis. This is the place where all processes and decisions our application depends on take place. Therefore, requirements for the business layer change more often than in any other layer. What hurts us, developers, most is that with every change, even the smallest ones, we need to recompile and rebuild our app. It usually takes a piece of the valuable time that we could use for more interesting things. What if we could move a business logic out of our code and let non-technician people change it?

JShell or Java Shell is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL). This means it evaluates expressions as and when they are entered and shows us the results.

A basic Java program needs you to go through the tedious process of writing a complete program before compiling it, fixing the errors, running it only to find that the output is not what you expected. Using a JShell helps you find problems as and when you’re developing code. You can run individual statements in a JShell and use APIs you have no idea about.

When we are developing an android application it is common to come across a situation where we want to show an image somewhere in the app.The easiest way to handle this is to bundle the image along with the app but the downside to it would be increasing the size of the app. It is not feasible if the application needs to display a lot of high resolution images.So, the next best thing is to host the image in some server and download it from there when the app starts. This is where image caching plays a very important role. We download the image once and store it in our cache and reuse it whenever required. This post will show how we can do that using just one annotation using the ColdStorage library.

Every programming problem involves some kind of algorithm. An algorithm, in this sense, is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain tasks; or simply a step-by-step way to solve a problem. There are about 700 programming languages. (Seriously: Here's a list.) So, what to learn and why to learn it - that's what most people are stuck on. From my perspective, you can (and should) choose learn any language. Learning the basics of one on-demand programming language will do you no harm. But: you must select ONE language that becomes your magic spell, and you should always be ready to create something out of it. Learning varieties of languages and not being able to do anything really well is like a curse.

Since then, the language has become widely spread—it was one of the five most used programming languages in 2019, and a fifth of Google search requests for programming tutorials were related to Java. No wonder both product owners and developers tend to use Java for software development, as Java is:

Versioning database changes is as important as versioning source code. By using a database migration tool we can safely manage how the database evolves, instead of running a bunch of non versioned loose SQL files. In some frameworks like Ruby On Rails, database versioning occurs along the development. But when it comes to Java world, I don't see it happening so often.

There are several thousand programming languages in the world. Even though many of them are incredibly unpopular, very specific, or have been created a long time ago, they still exist, and new languages continue to appear. It seems that there is no reason to believe that the number of languages will ever begin to decrease and that ultimately one universal programming language will emerge. The vast number of programming languages can frighten, but this very diversity allows us to move to a new level of multilingual project implementation. The article presents the idea of multilingual projects, which will enable developers not only to navigate in a variety of languages but also to see the benefits of their joint use.

I’ve been teaching Java for quite a while now. So I often share advice on how to learn programming faster and better. In talking to my students I can see that one thing distracts them very much: coding anxiety. It is a real trouble. Some people find it hard to focus their attention for more than one hour. Some are excessively stressed out by the job search.

Selenium is a widely used tool for automated browser testing. Being an open-source framework allowed Selenium to be compatible with multiple test automation frameworks for different programming languages and if we talk about automation testing with Selenium and JavaScript, there is a particular framework that never fails to take the spotlight and that is the Nightwatch.js. This is why I decided to come up with Nightwatch.js tutorial for beginners.

Continuous streams of data are ubiquitous and becoming even more so with the increasing number of IoT devices being used.
