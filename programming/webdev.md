You've probably heard of Tailwind by now, but if you haven't, it is essentially a utility-first CSS framework and is much less opinionated compared to other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation. 

### [265. Javascript: The Most Complex Language ](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-the-most-complex-language-for-me-k1e53ymu)

For me this is one of the strangest things I did in my life, talk to you about what is it for me one of the most complex languages that I have worked with. Javascript is something really strange when you compare it with other languages.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZXvwWhuaiAY0BoWkm8U7fJ1XTLI2-yl93ruw.jpeg)
If you’re a developer of any type of modern application, then you’re likely more than just familiar with APIs—you’re probably a power user.

### [267. Managing Django Media & Static Files on Heroku with Bucketeer](https://hackernoon.com/managing-django-media-and-static-files-on-heroku-with-bucketeer)

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FQabgMGCvjmY1fg3TSQtFH14qcG22-w02y3wp3.jpeg?alt=media&token=12efa548-8d2a-4ddb-b080-c14c5485fd8e)

### [270. 8 Great Material Admin Dashboards To Use In Your Project](https://hackernoon.com/8-great-material-admin-dashboards-to-use-in-your-project-vh1j3u62)

Looking through the admin template market you can easily conclude that this market is saturated. It’s observed in the number of templates, the amount of developers and (what is of the most important) a bunch of articles of «Best templates …(and here year, description or whatever goes)». And the amount of template becomes bigger and bigger every year. After reading several articles you may find out that to remember the name of the template you have liked is not (just believe us, really “not”) an easy task (of course, if you keep a template page in a browser tab it’s much easier, but don’t forget that RAM is limited and your browser may already keep 40+ tabs).

Nowadays, as a webdeveloper, you rarely build anything from scratch: your daily job mostly consists of integrating various Javascript libraries together. If you are building a web app you are most likely going to use some framework like React, Vue or Angular for your front-end. To transmit and manage the data you will be using Redux or GraphQL. For the backend, there will be Express and probably Loopback. Then you need to cover everything with tests, so Jest, Mocha or Jasmine must be present too. Finally, there will be UI frameworks like Bootstrap and maybe some charting tools. I have already counted at least 7 core libraries and all of these are in a single project! And what about underlying technologies like Javascript itself, Node.js and, probably, Typescript? Well, that’s a lot!

### [272. HTTP For Beginners - Part 1: Definitions](https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-http-part-1-definitions)
