![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/bj4al3yh9.png)
For the most part, Go developers are pretty good about using constants for global configuration, rather than global variables.  A problem arises however when we want a global constant slice or map. The go compiler doesn't allow these more complex types to be set as constant. Many developers, upon making this realization, decide to then use a dangerous global variable. In this article we will explore a better option.

Go has hard opinions about how you should style and format your code. The big upside of this is that you don't need to spend hours setting up tools like ESLint, Prettier, JSLint, etc. That said, in order to take advantage of the styling and listing tools available in the toolchain, you need a dev environment that makes them easy to use.
