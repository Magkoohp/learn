### [2. The Simple & Efficient Way to Enable JWT auth in Laravel By Using PHP-JWT Module](https://hackernoon.com/the-simple-and-efficient-way-to-enable-jwt-auth-in-laravel-a517c3202)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/ro18w32q4.png)
I encounter this issue while working on an application for a client recently. Instead of using a JWT library build for Laravel, I used firebase/php-jwt to generate and authenticate users. Don’t ask why as there were many reasons behind this decision. If you are using any Laravel library for JWT like tymondesigns/jwt-auth then you don’t need this anyway, use the library if you want.

The story of event logging begins at sea and is related to navigation. One of the important aspects of navigation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning" target="_blank">dead reckoning</a>: estimating your current position based on course, speed and time from a known, observed point. In the end of 15th century, speed at sea was measured with a small wooden log. A so-called ‘Dutchman’s Log’ was dropped overboard from the bow of the ship and the navigator measured the time elapsing before it passed the stern.

In the recent past, many technology firms were being targeted by hackers to tamper and corrupt the source code. These attacks heavily impact brand reputation and also leads to huge losses for firms victimized. To tackle this scenario, Code Signing techniques can be used for safeguarding the code integrity and to provide authenticity of the author to the end-user by providing digital signatures. Code Signing provides secure and trusted distribution of software preventing tampering, corruption and forgery. Code signing improves end-user confidence in software/code integrity and sender authenticity.

Standard authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and one-time passwords work as filters at the entrance of the protected perimeter. But what if someone managed to trick these filters or changed the user after their successful login? Cyber attackers may steal credentials of legitimate users and even one-time passcodes using malware and different phishing techniques. In the companies without special employee monitoring software, employees often nonchalantly share their logins and passwords with colleagues. Finally, there’s always a risk of someone getting a hold of a corporate device such as a laptop or smartphone with full access to the corporate network, critical resources, and applications.

Almost any organization experiences one of the main problems with the personnel policy - personnel discipline. It is particularly relevant for large companies. Here are several unpleasant consequences that this problem leads to. First of all, these are quite tangible hidden costs due to insufficient production of goods and services, foregone turnover, loss of important customers, and other losses from the irrational use of working time by employees. Let's say an employee takes 15-20 extra minutes every day to be late, protract a lunch break, have smoke breaks, go home early, and other things. Shouldn't be too hard to calculate that eventually it all takes an entire working day from one working month. In reality, people spend much more working time on personal needs: up to 35%.

Here, we have four roles: Sme, Sponsor, Admin, Operations.Initially, we had only 3 roles.Operations role was added later and Operations user has permissions similar to the Admin user.In the code, we had to replace every instance of if (user.type == USER_TYPES.ADMIN) with if (user.type == USER_TYPES.ADMIN || user.type == USER_TYPES.OPERATIONS).As this is time consuming and we can also miss many instances, we have created a roles module. In the roles module,the roles are defined along with their respective permissions as seen in Code (Part-III). Based on the permissions for each role, we will evaluate the authorization for the user in each of our controller methods.If the user has access, only then he will be granted the resources.

Ever get a Microsoft security alert email? One out of every 412 emails contains a malware attack. It doesn’t matter if you’re just a person sitting comfortably at home or a dedicated worker pushing one email after the other with short breaks of sweet old coffee. Every one of us is susceptible to these attacks and in a slightly twisted way we should all expect them. They could come in all shapes or sizes, and if you don’t want to lose a speech for your “Dyno week” conference that you spent a 100 hours writing maybe you shouldn’t let your friend open an email link with the subject line “Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova.”
