As software continues to eat the world, more and more people ask me about "getting into tech," i.e. a successful Software Engineer easily making around $350,000 in total annual compensation. I get asked this a lot because I had very little coding experience when I decided to make a career change into software. Four years after making that decision, I entered Twitter as a Senior Software Engineer with a compensation package I couldn't even dream of making elsewhere. I often look back and refer to my career change as the best decision I made in my life.

Agile software development means different things to different people. In this post, we will define what agile software development is with a simple analogy that a five-year-old can understand. The analogy we will use is as straightforward as serving an apple to 4 kids. Yes, it will be that easy, let‚Äôs get started:

### [256. The Most Important Enginnering KPIs for Your Board Deck](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-choose-software-development-kpis-for-your-board-deck-8jz3u7l)

Preparing for a board meeting is a stressful experience for everyone. For many CTOs, it‚Äôs also an exercise in futility, trying to zero in on engineering KPIs that accurately represent everything that‚Äôs happened in the department. The information that usually makes it to the board deck ‚Äî information on completed features and incident reports ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story.

A list of features shows what the team accomplished, but doesn‚Äôt reveal anything about how the team works. It can‚Äôt reveal process issues that need to be addressed or highlight challenges the team has overcome. Similarly, incident reports might illuminate problems in the codebase, but they‚Äôre devoid of context about how the team is dealing with those issues. Other departments have self-evident, objective KPIs. Sales, for example, can walk through their pipeline from demos booked to contracts signed, using objective measurements to chart their department‚Äôs progress over time. 

Engineering leaders, on the other hand, must get creative to provide that level of clarity. 

You‚Äôll need to think carefully about the story you want your slides to tell, then choose engineering KPIs that map to those specific insights. When considering a metric, we recommend asking:

It is not a secret that in many companies, expenses on salaries of IT departments‚Äô employees make up a significant part of the budget. And the high competition in the labor market further pushes the level of wages for IT specialists. High expenses lead to the fact that the employer is always searching for options to reduce their costs. It turned out, the companies themselves, trying to reduce costs as much as possible, turn to various tricks to reduce the cost of the work done. Similar mechanisms are used not only in IT but also in different other areas of the employer. But let‚Äôs talk about everything in order.

If you can‚Äôt answer it, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not alone. Many engineering leaders couldn‚Äôt tell you without some significant number-crunching. Gaining visibility into performance is only half the battle though. Knowing how to interpret metrics and how to apply them to improving performance is where the magic happens. Many CEOs do not know how to align engineering metrics to business KPIs (revenue, customer retention, etc.).¬†Bringing metrics to your board or non-technical CEO for the first time may be challenging if you are unable to help them bridge the gap.

One would expect that writing code which any programmer can read and understand would be an inherent skill of software developers. The fact is that¬†only 20% of programmers have this ability. The code that you are writing must be understood not only by the machine but also by humans. In software development, quality should be everyone‚Äôs priority. Throughout the development process, the goal should be the delivery of good quality and working code.

As software engineers, we strive to better our craft and leave a lasting mark on the organizations we work for. Throughout our careers, we balance two types of knowledge: the combination of business domain and technical stack is our bread and butter. Sometimes we might value the business domain over the technical stack and vice versa as we expand our toolkit. For example, we might work at a financial institution (let‚Äôs call it Acme Investment Bank) for a broad domain, but where the tech stack is not bleeding edge. On the other hand, we might roll the dice and work for a firm that has a bleeding-edge tech stack but where the domain is very specific, like a company that sells wine to your pets.¬†

Technical debt can appear because of business pressure, lack of requirements, lack of interaction between team members etc. However, good software engineers know how to manage the technical debt and do that. Bad software engineers simply hide the tech debt from managers and customers, hoping that the project will be completed before it gets out of hand.

I loved being a software engineer, or so I thought. On my last project working as an engineer, I fondly recall spending my weekends writing code to finish any user stories in my queue. It got to the point that I completed my work so far in advance that I was running a few sprints ahead of my team. I started to use my newfound free time during the week to sit in as many application requirement gathering meetings as possible. I began to collaborate more with our design team and shadow interviews with customers about the product we were building. I shifted into more of a mentorship role for our engineering team. At times, I found myself explaining the rationale behind a feature design decision and bouncing ideas around for an architectural approach in the same conversation. It took me a while to reach this career-changing realization; I was more interested in shaping the product than building it.¬†

Artificial intelligence (AI) affected the majority of industries all over the world. There are a lot of definitions of what AI means, but we think that the most relevant is to consider artificial intelligence as the process of adaptation to a new environment, collection of new knowledge, and using it in new scenarios. AI can be adapted to all spheres of human life, it can automate some processes or partly replace humans. AI systems and tools can demonstrate some of the human intelligence behavior: learning, planning, motion, creativity, manipulation, and many others. Generally, artificial intelligence is a form of adaptable intellect, which can inherit human behavior.¬†

Back at the dawn of the modern computing era, one Donald Knuth published a book titled "The Art of Computer Programming" that soon  became a bible of software engineering and defined many generations of computer programmers to come. This book, which was intended as a compendium of computer algorithms, had also put forward a very important idea: software engineering is a form of art. At the time, that was the prevailing point of view.

Well-written multitier applications consist of multiple layers. The most widespread three-tier architecture divides our code into a presentation, business and data access tiers. Like it or not, but the business layer is where we, developers, spend the most time on a daily basis. This is the place where all processes and decisions our application depends on take place. Therefore, requirements for the business layer change more often than in any other layer. What hurts us, developers, most is that with every change, even the smallest ones, we need to recompile and rebuild our app. It usually takes a piece of the valuable time that we could use for more interesting things. What if we could move a business logic out of our code and let non-technician people change it?

DevOps, the term seems a buzz word for many from the last few years, but this buzzword is the most searched term on the internet by IT recruiters, software firms, and agencies. When it comes to DevOps, the pro enthusiasts argue saying it is never about the tools or automation, but they miss to see that, in fact, tools are the ones that take over the culture ones the DevOps culture is set in any firm. We all agree DevOps is not only about the tools, nor even an individual role, perhaps, it should be a group effort, DevOps is a trinity of people, process and tools. But to enable DevOps, in any organization, DevOps tools play a vital role.¬†
