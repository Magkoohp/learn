Have you heard of software companies struggling to go through the stages of business development? Yes, of course, all of them do. The CEO oversees the company, ensuring that there are enough funds and the team is set up to get the right things done properly. But this is not a one time phase. It is an ongoing challenge. The company must continue to develop to remain competitive and infiltrate new markets.

### [74. Objects vs. Actors](https://hackernoon.com/objects-vs-actors-6l1g3ex4)

Readers are assumed to have at least a passing familiarity with an object-oriented language and an actor-oriented language (e.g. Erlang,
Pony). Note that objects and actors are orthogonal abstractions and
therefore a language may implement both – Pony is an example.
Language abstractions orthogonal to both objects and actors will not
be considered here, e.g. static vs. dynamic typing. Because Pony
mixes objects and actors, this paper will use Erlang as the prototype
for actors in order to draw a sharper contrast between objects and
actors. Further exposition of Pony will require its own paper.

You shouldn't be using a REST or RESTful interface for communication between your microservices. I'm not saying that to be controversial, I'm saying it because that's not what REST was designed for, it's not what REST is good at and it's definitely not the best nor easiest option out there.

It is designed for walking (assuming you like hills), it provides easy access to hospitals and it is guarded by police and fire departments.

The development life cycles of applications in an enterprise environment often follow a common theme. An application begins life with a clear purpose in mind and over time has requirements brought in that cause incremental additions to the scope of the original concept. These additions could either be completely in sync with the original concept or perhaps the requirement just had no better home to belong in. As the application matures to an end-of-life state it has now grown far past its original intended purpose and is in dire need of a refactor — breaking down the monolithic beast into smaller and more succinct components.

Most of the startups facing scaling problems move to microservices. Inspired by cell-based architecture, it split services per function and scale only specific features. It works especially well for B2C where traffic is uniformly spread across users. However, B2B can face a different type of scaling issue where only one user is scaling. A pool architecture is a simpler yet powerful solution, used both by GAFA and fast-growing startups.

We have created this blog post for business stakeholders managing the development of a software system or product, those looking to find ways to reduce cost and time to market. This post will be useful for those whose technical background is a bit outdated or isn’t sufficient to make that judgment call. We will look at how to approach architecture planning so that the product is scalable and the money is spent wisely. Also, we will show the example of how CQRS can help in the implementation of client applications and whether microservices is indeed the panacea.

The concept of microservices, an approach to designing a software application as a set of small services, has been around since at least 2015.Delivering benefits such as the independent deployability and scalability of components, microservices are all the rage today. This is because these microservices benefits translate into incredibly faster software development speeds. With consumers being quick to change their preferences and behaviors, microservices adopters are able to keep up. Life is now great, they say.As much as 56% of companies participating in a recent IMB survey plan to adopt a microservices approach in the next 24 months. Almost 80% of current users say their business will likely step up investment in microservices.Microservices advantages have prompted Netflix, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and many other tech giants to migrate from monolithic to microservices architecture.But should your company use microservices?It depends on the context and if microservices pros outweigh the cons for your application.This blog provides an overview of a microservices vs. monolithic approach and five key benefits of using a microservices architecture. It also shares some of ITRex’s microservices experience and offers tips on when business should (not) use microservices. Dive in.

Having recently worked with young web developers who were exposed for the first time to proper production infrastructure, I received many questions about the various components that one can find in the architecture of a "Web service". These questions clearly expressed the 
confusion (and sometimes the frustration) of developers who understand 
how to create endpoints in a high-level language such as Node.js or Python, but were never introduced to the complexity of what happens 
between the user's browser and their framework of choice. Most of the 
time they don't know why the framework itself is there in the first place.
