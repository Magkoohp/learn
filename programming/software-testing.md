The faster we get feedback, the better. That also applies to end-to-end automated tests. Considering the trend toward low code solutions for test automation at the UI level, we wanted to run some experiments comparing the execution time of some of the most popular options. Low code solutions are great because they have a less steep learning curve, but they are less useful in evaluating new code changes if the feedback is delayed due to slow running tests.

After development, the next phase involving quality assurance and testing is crucial to the success of the software. Proper QA testing identifies redundancies, inconsistencies, bugs, and defects in a newly developed product. Without this process, there’s no way to find out the ability of the product to survive in the real world and to work as intended for many years.
