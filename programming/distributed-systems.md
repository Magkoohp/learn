Imagine — You’re in a system design interview and need to pick a database to store, let’s say, order-related data in an e-commerce system. Your data is structured and needs to be consistent, but your query pattern doesn’t match with a standard relational DB’s. You need your transactions to be isolated, and atomic and all things ACID… But OMG it needs to scale infinitely like Cassandra!! So how would you decide what storage solution to choose? Well, let’s see!

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/gi87i2bb3.png)
When learning about blockchain consensus algorithms and distributed systems in general, you will inevitably come across terms like FLP impossibility and Byzantine fault tolerance. While there is plenty of literature on these subjects, it often suffers from a narrow focus, failing to explain the connections and relationships between them. Furthermore, much of the existing literature gives either too much or not enough technical detail — I found this to be especially true when learning about consensus algorithms like the proof of stake.

With the emergence of microservices architecture, applications are developed by using a large number of smaller programs. These programs are built individually and deployed into a platform where they can scale independently. These programs communicate with each other over the network through simple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). With the disaggregated and network distributed nature of these applications, developers have to deal with the Fallacies of Distributed Computing as part of their application logic.
