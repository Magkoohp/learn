I've struggled and spent a lot of hours writing manual Python scripts to be able to test a product involving many microservices. All of them following the REST conventions. Overwhelmed with too many scripts, each one test different endpoints, how they respond also what they respond, I've decided to create a Python package to easily do this, without needing to create a manual Python script, import libraries to send an HTTP Request, copy and paste code from other scripts to test fast the new endpoints, etc.

All software companies strive to produce quality products. The journey begins with a product that works. Software correctness is usually defined as the adherence of software to its specification. In most cases, formal verification is not possible. As such, we typically impose functional correctness with test coverage.

Have you ever wanted to write unit tests for your code, but youâ€™ve found that itâ€™s difficult to do so? Often this is the result of not writing code with testing in mind. An easy way to solve this is through utilizingÂ test-driven development, a development process in which you write your testsÂ beforeÂ your app code.

Whenever youâ€™re developing software, a certain amount of refactoring and rewriting is inevitable. This is sometimes due to a new idea that will simplify the design or a change to the project requirements. But unfortunately, it often also happens because of a misunderstanding about how the software will connect and interact with its external environment. While itâ€™s impossible to completely avoid such miscommunication, you can minimize it by using a principle I call writing software from the outside in.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a really powerful tool that helps us build robust, value-based software. You can sometimes hear detractors say that it brings a lot of complexity and leads to long tests difficult to maintain. Let's take stock of what BDD really is, by determining anti-patterns and best practices.

For the last few of months I started digging into the software testing world. I really wanted to learn more about how to create more effective tests, refactor code with more confidence and feel safe about adding new features. However, I felt it is little difficult to dive right in this area, that in my point of view, is underestimated.

On my journey on Microverse, one of the things that troubled me the most to understand was RSpec, a Ruby gem for Test-Driven Development. The concept is quite simple. You create tests as you code along, so in the future, if an update breaks something, it will be easy to notice because one or more tests will fail.
