The internet of things, IoT, has been a dream of tech lovers for as long as tech lovers have been around.

As we move closer and closer to this becoming a reality, we start to realize that there are some huge hurdles we have to overcome before we can fully implement the internet of things. Blockchain technology will play a huge role in overcoming those hurdles, and as we usher in a new age of smart homes we’ll definitely be thankful for the added security and peace of mind. According to Techcrunch.com, more than a quarter of adults in the US own a smart speaker — never has it been more important for blockchain technology to be seriously considered for a rapidly growing industry.

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been in the rumors since 2013, with China allegedly developing in secrecy a government-issued centralized cryptocurrency to fight off the increasingly popular Bitcoin. But it wasn’t until September 2015 when the Bank of England had publicly discussed for the first time the use of a blockchain-based central bank currency as a way to implement negative interest rates, and March 2016 when the phrase “central bank digital currency” had been coined.

### [28. AI and Cryptocurrency Interactions You May Not Know About](https://hackernoon.com/ai-and-cryptocurrency-interactions-you-may-not-know-about-r51431o1)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/3qmnoVcnvbPEnAxh0gTS24sNuH42-dl1131ch.jpeg)
You often hear AI thrown into a sentence with Bitcoin or blockchain technology. Often this generates more interest in cryptocurrencies as AI has been the “next big thing” for quite some time now.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/uqr330r.jpg)
When comes to trading, centralized exchange rule the crypto market. Based on some of the work we have done at IntoTheBlock, we believe around 40% of the daily volume in major cryptocurrencies is processed through centralized exchanges. Sadly, centralized exchanges are also one of the most difficult components to analyze in the crypto space and a regular source of poor/fake data.

When you look at some of the world’s largest unicorns you can see a few clear trends. These companies typically entered their respective markets with an idea and a disruptive tech, exciting both investors and consumers alike. Unicorns like Bytedance (the creators of TikTok), SpaceX, Stripe, Airbnb, DoorDash, and more all share the same thread - they used a disruptive technology to do something better than their competitors. All of these companies share another thread, though. They are all working to integrate other disruptive technologies to stay ahead of the competition. What if you skipped the first step and started integrating multiple disruptive technologies from day one?

Bitcoin has come a long way in its eleven or so years of existence. It was created to be a ‘peer-to-peer electronic cash system’, but it has become so much more than that today. In fact, Bitcoin has crossed over quite significantly from being a currency to being more of an investable asset.

![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/gg7633zs.jpg)
Value indicators are one of the cornerstones of quantitative(quant) trading. Even today, in the mist of the golden era of quant investing, most strategies were based on variations of three fundamental indicators: value, size and momentum. In the case of crypto-assets, value indicators are entirely clear as there is no established methodology to evaluate the value of this new asset class. What it is clear, however, is that establishing some notion of value indicators is foundational to assessing the potential of crypto assets. Years ago, Wall Street legend James O’Shaughnessy proposed one of the most famous quant value strategies of all time. Today, I would like to revisit some of those ideas in the context of crypto assets.
