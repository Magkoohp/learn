Back in the 1990’s, then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan used the phrase “irrational exuberance” to describe the rapid and relentless rise of stock markets amidst a preponderance of data that should have tempered market mania. Setting aside Greenspan’s role in stimulating such “irrational exuberance” via interest rate driven monetary policy, it seems as though his phrase is ripe for recycling when looking at the current fever for “decentralization”; particularly, decentralization as it would apply to blockchain, Web 3.0, and cryptocurrencies. Can blockchain as a foundation of Web 3.0 really be decentralized?

### [27. It's No Longer "The Future of Work", DAOs Are Already Here](https://hackernoon.com/its-no-longer-the-future-of-work-daos-are-already-here-dv1l3xvq)
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FvdxHWWsSmxWRHjGuJOxi8EJv8Lr2-a3eg3ynk.jpeg?alt=media&token=93aaa92f-8d00-44a3-895c-0c93ccde5bdd)
The future is now, it's 2020 and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are experiencing a Cambrian explosion.

Typically in an enterprise, you have top-down hierarchies as the mechanism of control. Let's look at a quick example of how a DAO works differently in action. 

Imagine you’re building a startup, except at this startup, there is a clear sense of organization without humans organizing other humans. It all runs organically, and it's generative in nature, meaning it evolves, innovates and experiences high growth from within. 

Leaderless leadership!

How is such a way of working together achieved? 

Through active participation from interested parties who share common values, missions and objectives. People-driven autonomous organizations happen mostly through voting on decisions that are proposed by other community members.

You can propose, vote and discuss decisions as a team without having to have a singular authority to report to. Resulting in new ideas being seeded and proposed from within the organization to solve mission-critical challenges that the DAO is facing.

It's really a synthesis of innovation and ambition, it's great!

With that said there are certainly some balanced benefits and drawbacks about this model that we should explore. 

For the moment DAOs function in a fairly binary nature, you vote on proposals that you or others have submitted, typically these votes take place on blockchains by signing a transaction with your crypto wallet. That means the current state of DAOs is experiencing the highest growth in the blockchain industry. So whilst DAOs are now, they might be somewhat gravitating around the future of money.

However crypto-centric it is right now, it is definitely laying out an exceptional framework that any organization type could be built upon. We are seeing many other non-crypto DAOs emerge too, using platforms like Aragon to create a DAO in minutes on the blockchain. This is achieved by creating a Governance Token on the Ethereum blockchain. When users hold these Governance Tokens they can vote on proposals put forward to the community.

These communities can even have treasuries where the DAO can organize their finances. For example, members that hold these Governance Tokens can suggest making a payment, creating a vote inside the community so it can be approved or denied collectively. 

There are many lessons to learn about how to coordinate large groups of self-interested people. 

I recently wrote an article, "Failure shows us the way", where I outlined my thesis on how I think we can even coordinate groups who don't explicitly share the same values, they instead just share the same mission. It's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds with the DAOs that are experimenting right now. 

Why are DAOs exploding right now? 

Basically there is an entire unstoppable movement happening because of projects offering up a Governance Token as a bonus to those who are using some Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.

I've heard many stories from folks achieving incredible results in less than 5 days. For example, "With YFI I earned like $3.5k on $24k", one community member shared with me. 

That example is a 14.58% increase in capital in just five days, no wonder it's getting attention.

Wait, how are people making money from these Governance Tokens?

In the DeFi world, there is a new meme known as Yield Farming 👨‍🌾  its technical name is Liquidity Mining. 

This is where a user deposits crypto stablecoins like USDC, DAI & USDT to earn a reasonably safe and secure return, which lately seems to be roughly 8% APY. As well as this, these DeFi applications which have newly formed their own DAOs to oversee their protocols, are rewarding users with Governance Tokens when they have funds deposited into their various DeFi products.

This has added rocket fuel to the DeFi community, with an explosive $3 Billion USD flowing into projects in just the last couple of weeks. This doesn't stop here either, there are many more DAO innovations that will be made known during this wave of Governance Tokens. One example is Referral Yield Farming, where you can earn Governance Tokens for referring people to DeFi platforms without having to deposit any funds of your own.

Crypto lending is a growing market that started only a few years ago. Unless you're new to cryptocurrency, you probably have heard this term at some point. Crypto lending works similarly to peer-to-peer lending, where borrowers are connected with lenders via an online crypto lending platform with cryptocurrency as the currency of trade instead of fiat money.

The year 2019 is coming to an end, and the blockchain hype seems to be slowly dying as well as the crypto bubble. But is it really dead or maybe now it has to offer even more than it had in 2017 when the total market capitalization of crypto was near $800 billion? In reality, it was something like a great purge for many unprofessional projects. Without investors throwing money at them, they died, like dotcom bubble projects before them. The general audience begins to understand that the blockchain technology isn't something that makes everything it's applied to revolutionary. It has its own applications, where it can shine, such as finances and supply chains, but also there can be many occasions where blockchain is totally unnecessary. For example, maybe creating a decentralized network for dentists isn’t such a good idea?

Most crypto traders are comparing 2020 with 2017 when Bitcoin hit its all-time-high of $20,000 and altcoins were doing a 2-5-10x in just a matter of days. This year is different, though. Traders, holders, and investors have more knowledge and the market growth is not based on hype. The crypto market is close to reaching mainstream adoption and that wouldn’t be possible without all the DeFi (Decentralized Projects) that are making crypto more accessible and easy to use for the average user.

When people think of anarchy, they think of the world on fire or complete and utter chaos. However, that is not the case. When I say anarcho-capitalism, I am not advocating for a traditional anarchist society but rather an anarcho-capitalist one. Two entirely different things. That being said, let me get into my "key points". As our intellectual capabilities increase as society so should our own sovereignty as nations. In a perfectly intellectual society, one wouldn't need a government to function. The current generation tends to blame capitalism for most of the world's problems, embracing socialism. I would say, capitalism is the answer and that many of the problems capitalism is blamed for is actually globalism disguised as capitalism.

Africa is rarely mentioned as a major cryptocurrency market. However, recent trends indicate that it may move leaders out of their positions. In 2018, in just 9 months, more than 15 cryptocurrency trading platforms were opened in Africa. The trend has appeared a long time ago and is only getting stronger every year. When the bitcoin rate rose in 2017, the trading volume on African exchanges increased sharply. For example, trading volumes in Kenya on one of the sites in December 2017 rose to $ 8.1 million. Another company reported 2,000 BTC transactions in November 2017, when the price fluctuated in the $ 10,000 range. Approximately 37% of these transactions were made in South Africa. There are several reasons why Africa could be the next big cryptocurrency market. The Free TON team believes that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are key to unlocking Africa’s vast potential. Only blockchain is capable of transforming the continent, this technology will contribute to the growth and prosperity of all countries in the 21st century, giving everyone complete control over their finances.

Every crypto and DeFi enthusiast knows what difficulties he might face during blockchain project development: strict regulation, a public opinion upon the entire industry, lack of assets security. However, let’s ask ourselves a question: What stands above all of it? Uncertain future of Digital Finance? Hardly. Dependency on the Bitcoin rate?

The yield farming space is probably the most confusing piece of the crypto puzzle. At its most basic, it involves locking up ETH, USDT or other types of tokens into a smart contract. The difference lies in the specifics of the smart contract, as well as the number and enthusiasm of participants. The common thread is the possibility to receive passive income, instead of holding onto tokens long-term while hoping for gains!

In turn, the financiers can provide extensions on the payables depending on the credit-worthiness of the buyer in question.
