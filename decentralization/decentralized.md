The global crisis is causing an explosive increase in demand for stablecoins. Some even say that it's stablecoins that will drive the mass adoption of crypto, not hypervolatile coins like Bitcoin. It's time to ask the question: which stablecoins will benefit more from the recession – regular ones, such as USDT, or decentralized ones, like DAI and others?

The widespread use of social media has changed the way we communicate, however, not everyone thinks these changes are positive. For example, the lack of strict moderation of social media content has contributed to the spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 outbreak.Even before COVID-19, many users were unsatisfied of how social media platforms were addressing disinformation, censorship, privacy, political neutrality, user control, and malicious activity. Decentralized social networks and communities are more flexible than centralized ones, but they provide more opportunities for the disadvantages that are suppressed in centralized communities. This is the small paradox of decentralized communities.

On Web2 or the traditional web, storage systems were designed to suit
fast-growing, collaborative environments. These storage systems boasted different degrees of data availability and data security and protection from loss. As Web2 grew in adoption so did the generation of Web2 data volume and density in many formats. This data could be large files, non-transactional, often created by a single user, and may be shared over some geographical distance. This design led to the reliance on central authorities to store the world's data.
