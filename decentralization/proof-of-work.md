![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/fuv32wf.png)
INTRODUCTIONThe blockchain technology and the opportunities it created began to enter our lives about 10 years ago. The technology that we are most familiar with is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that uses the blockchain technology. After the invention of Bitcoin many other cryptocurrencies have followed suit. Bitcoin is still at the top and was the first to introduce the Proof of Work algorithm, which we'll talk about in a moment, however, this system is now quite outdated. In this article we are going to discuss the technical aspects of the Blockchain technology, Bitcoin and the algorithms it uses and applications for the Blockchain technology.

### [31. Bitcoin White Paper: 4. Proof-of-Work](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-white-paper-4-proof-of-work-k029k2b6i)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/eo29i2bp9.jpg)
To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system  similar to Adam  Back's  Hash cash  [6],  rather than  newspaper  or  Usenet  posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.

Ethereum gas fees have been on the rise since the beginning of the year. In the latest developments, miners on the world’s second-largest blockchain protocol voted to increase the gas limit from 10 to 12.5 million Gwei. This increase of 25 percent in miner fees contributes to the more than 75 percent rise year-to-date.
