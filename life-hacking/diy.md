I am a frequent traveler and I love to do weekend trips. It feels soothing to go for a night out with family and friends. More so when you can see the objects and feel the surroundings with proper gears. It was my last trip when I discovered that we seriously needed a night gear for enjoying our trips to the fullest.

### [10. Misunderstanding of Voltage Sharing Problem of Series Diode ](https://hackernoon.com/misunderstanding-of-voltage-sharing-problem-of-series-diode-3w1q32eh)
![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/drafts/4uai32i5.png)
Since the reverse withstand voltage of the  step-recovery diode is limited, when used in a high- voltage environment, it is often necessary to use plurality of step-recovery rectifier diodes in series to meet the need of reverse withstand voltage. Due to the inconsistency in the volt-ampere characteristics, turn-on time, and recovery charges of the diode during the production process, the voltage sharing problem occurs when used in series, which causes the reverse voltage of a certain diode to be too high and damaged, disturbing the normal operation of other diodes, which ultimately affects the reliability and stability of the entire device.

Carbon film resistors are a type of film resistor. It uses high-temperature vacuum coating technology to closely attach carbon to the surface of the ceramic rod to form a carbon film. Then appropriate joints are added for cutting, and the surface is coated with epoxy resin for sealing protection. The surface is often painted with green protective paint.

### [16. Turn your old useless laptop screen into an external monitor](https://hackernoon.com/https-medium-com-akshaykore-diy-monitor-410ac3bbb6b9)

For far too long I possessed an old Dell Studio laptop. It served me well for a good 5 years with a number of service centre visits, battery and hard disk replacements, formats and OS upgrades. From the past few years I have ditched the old laptop for a Macbook. Yet still, I never bothered to dispose of it. After all it still works (slow af but works!). <em>What if there is an ‘emergency’ situation where I need to use this ancient piece of technology?</em> I tried selling it, but the act itself and the price I get for it is honestly not worth it. Giving it to someone for free feels like a punishment to the person (most smartphones have better specs). Disposing it off just doesn’t feel right (yeah right! That’s the middle class in me speaking. Also not very good for the environment).
