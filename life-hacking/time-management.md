The World is full of distractions, the more you try to ignore a string of distractions the more you find yourself tangled in those strings of distraction. We are never taught how to manage our time nor our finance. It is the thing that we have to manage or learn on our own. The truth is people actually never learn to manage their time. They just do things whatever they have or according to their priorities. But within these priorities, people tend to get lost in their thoughts, urges, or fictional societies. In between these priorities, it’s really complicated to stay focused and do things. We easily get lost and get distracted. Staying focused for a longer time is tough for your brain. Especially when you are doing intensive work or in short the thing that releases a few dopamines.
