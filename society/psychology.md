![](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/vo68h39s6.jpg)
Interest in the dWeb is blossoming, but decentralized systems require cooperation in order to work.

It’s going to take communities of ultra-cooperation to work. But can we rely on networks of people (some or all of whom are self-interested) to deliver? Call me the optimist, but I think humans actually have the necessary "stuff" to make it work well. Here, I lay out some of our evolved moral fabric, and how that moral fabric can be tailored to socially scale the decentralized web.
