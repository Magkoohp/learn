The media is a key point of contact for the marketing team of any startup. As a tech journalist and freelance writer, I talk to hundreds of SMEs, startups, fortune 500 companies, investors and industry experts every year.

For the past few years now, the increasing digitalization of customer journeys and the exponential improvement of cloud technologies and computing capacities have invited media groups to rethink the way they do business. If it sounds like I‚Äôm using long words to say ‚Äúdigital disruption‚Äù, trust your instinct. Many of these disruptions have been centered around the mountains of data media groups have access to, and what Artificial Intelligence (AI) (and machine learning more specifically) could do with it. Indeed, while artificial intelligence has been fully embraced by a plethora of pure players (Spotify, Netflix, Buzzfeed, Disney‚Ä¶) traditional actors are still lagging, and now see the technology as a shortcut to a much-needed renewed growth.

2,281 days ago Product Hunt launched as a tiny newsletter. The early days were especially chaotic. I didn‚Äôt get much sleep, skipped the gym, and buried my head into work. While unsustainable (I'm not advocating overworking yourself!), it was sooo fun and energizing to build something brand new. It was also scary. New products ‚Äì especially those driven by community ‚Äì are incredibly fragile.

7 days ago we launched a beta of YourStack (with a¬†grammatically incorrect, non-editable tweet¬†‚Äì lol). Instantly those same nostalgic feelings from the early days of Product Hunt re-emerged. The response has been very encouraging. Alex was kind enough to¬†write about it on BuzzFeed. Lucas followed with a¬†story on TechCrunch. And a bunch of folks shared support on Twitter and¬†Product Hunt.

But the product is very early and our roadmap is deep. So far we've onboarded only ~4% of those that have signed up as we build tooling to scale (thanks for all your patience!). I wake up each morning nervous but excited to read your feedback and wild ideas as the team and I continue building.

If you get a chance, create your account and start stacking. We're whitelisting new friendly folks each day.

Feedback? I'd love to hear it at¬†ryan@yourstack.com.

Cheers,
Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover)

The history, condition, and direction of communication, media, civilization, and the whole of humankind is not complete without discussing the essence and history of money. The history of human civilization can be explained by the constant struggle between two tendencies--centralization vs. decentralization‚Äîexemplified by what has unfolded in the development and evolution of communication media technologies. The same is true for money; or what we should more accurately refer to as currency. You might ask, what does money have to do with communication, marketing, and media? Everything.

Last year was a gamechanger for the entertainment industry. Why so? Because it was the year that podcasts hit their stride, with more than half of Americans having listened to a podcast and an estimated 32% listening monthly as of March of last year - the largest annual increase since podcast-related data started being tracked in 2008.

As a Microverse student for one month, I realized that my first clone webpages didn‚Äôt have a responsive layout. I was using pixels in the Navbars, percentages in one section and rem in another, I didn‚Äôt have a rule or a standard procedure. The goal was to make it look like the original webpage IN MY SCREEN.

As I advanced through the course, I learned that these units made all the
difference to the webpage‚Äôs response in different screen sizes. My code
reviewers would tell me to adjust my webpage because it looked different when they were viewing it.

When I started having these issues, I made a lot of research on the subject,
but I was still a little confused about it. This article‚Äôs goal is to create a
simple and direct rule to achieve the required responsiveness any developer needs in their code.

On friday 20th of March, I and many thousands of UK business owners, self-employed workers and unemployed workers eagerly tuned into the 5pm news, hoping to catch a vital update on whether the government would be offering us the essential aid that we need to survive the coming 3 months.

When Tom and I started Genius in 2009, we wanted to build something that would grow bigger than rap lyrics. The first 4 songs I annotated on RapExegesis, as it was originally called, were rap songs. However, the 5th one was Elton John's "Rocket Man", the 6th was The Eagles' "Hotel California", and the 7th was a poem, the first non-lyrics post on the site - Emily Dickinson's "I'm Nobody!  Who Are You?"
