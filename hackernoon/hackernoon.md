Colors. Some people talk about how HackerNoon green is a thing. And it is, 100M+ people have visited HackerNoon, and some percentage thought, hmm are they really leading with #00FF00?

How colors make us feel and how colors frame our ability to focus on the story or wander into the metaverse, this is because the individual's emotional relationship with color is entirely their own. As we work to make our software more accessible, this new release by Jeferson Borba provides all visitors with the ability to choose the primary color of the site and primary color of the ad placement. Just because I like green without red or blue does not mean you have to too. Choose your colors!

Find a Niche!

Nobody can promote themselves or their projects if they're a jack of all trades. Nor will people find a universal proposition to be appealing. The first key to success is to ask yourself what your differentiating features are and who is your audience? You can then start to identify your niche.

In my case, I noticed that I got a lot more traffic from my money-making code like market making or arbtitrage crypto trading bots than I did from my other GitHub repos. What this means is that while some people are interested in interesting code, there are a lot more people out there interested in turning equity into realized pnl :)
