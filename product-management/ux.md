User Experience or UX has been known to make or break several careers. Polish your understanding of UX here.

### [1. Apple‚Äôs Icons Have That Shape for a Very Good Reason](https://hackernoon.com/apples-icons-have-that-shape-for-a-very-good-reason-720d4e7c8a14)

If you haven‚Äôt been immersed in <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/ios" target="_blank">iOS</a> interface <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/design" target="_blank">design</a>, you might look at Apple‚Äôs icons and think that they‚Äôre just a rounded square or a ‚Äòroundrect‚Äô. If you‚Äôve been designing icons, you know that they‚Äôre something different and may have heard the word <a href="https://applypixels.com/the-hunt-for-the-squircle/" target="_blank">squircle</a> used (mathematical intermediate of a square and a circle). And if you‚Äôre an Industrial Designer, you recognize this as a core signature of their hardware products.

GUI design has become the best choice of user interface design. Nevertheless, in spite of the unpredictable popularity of GUI, few application programs have good interface design and live up to graphic user interface design principles. Additionally, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to use the expertise and existing documents to explain what an excellent and direct-viewing operation interface is.

Hey there üëãThanks for checking my first Hackernoon article. My name is Vova and I'm a self-taught front-end engineer. I started learning front-end two years ago and was lucky to land my first job in a tech startup. Getting the first job is (very) challenging but the startup I applied to wanted to give equal chances to the professionals of all levels.

So the last 1.5 years I was playing with React, Redux, Webpack, fetch, Node.js, Express.js Backend, Webhooks.‚Ä¶You know, in a startup you are wearing different hats. I was making 20+ landing pages, setting up A/B tests, helping the marketing team to make automation and eventually doing some design tasks.

That's fun and I always enjoyed design tasks, even if they were small. So it became asking myself, what other people are using for making design tasks?

Here is what I got from a small Twitter research:

The React JS dev team announced some exciting changes several months ago - React would be getting a "Concurrent Mode". Essentially this would allow React to perform multiple UI renders concurrently. Of course, JavaScript is single threaded and true concurrency is an illusion, but the new features will allow web apps (and Native Apps once these features hit React Native) to be much more responsive and snappy than they are now with less effort and custom code from the developer to make this happen.

Some of the most common approaches to solve a problem are situational or context-specific.¬†For example, in the field of structural engineering, most of the challenges are solved by applying time tested rules in the field of civil engineering.

The first reaction to solve any problem is to compartmentalize the problem into something which was solved earlier. The mind likes the comfort of the known after all. This is our primordial nature.
